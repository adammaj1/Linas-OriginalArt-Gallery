\begin_layout Abstract
The beta transformation is the iterated map 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta x\,\mod1$
\end_inset

.
 The special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

 is known as the Bernoulli map, and is exactly solvable.
 The Bernoulli map provides a model for pure, unrestrained chaotic (ergodic)
 behavior: it is the full invariant shift on the Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 The Cantor space consists of infinite strings of binary digits; it is notable
 for many properties, including that it can represent the real number line.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The beta transformation defines a subshift: iterated on the unit interval,
 it singles out a subspace of the Cantor space that is invariant under the
 action of the left-shift operator.
 That is, lopping off one bit at a time gives back the same subspace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This text reviews assorted general properties, and then focuses primarily
 on the transfer operator (the Ruelle–Frobenius–Perron operator) and it's
 spectrum.
 Discrete eigenvalues seem to lie on a circle of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

 in the complex plane.
 Given that the transfer operator is purely real, the appearance of such
 a quasi-unitary spectrum unexpected.
 The spectrum appears to be the limit of a dense set of quasi-cyclotomic
 polynomials, the positive real roots of which include the Golden and silver
 ratios, the Pisot numbers, the n-bonacci (tribonacci, tetranacci, 
\emph on
etc.
\emph default
) numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This text does not assume much mathematical sophistication on the part of
 the reader, and should be approachable by those with minimal or no prior
 experience in ergodic theory.
 Most of the development is casual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta transformation is the map 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{\beta}(x)=\beta x\mod1
\]

\end_inset

iterated on the real unit interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 taken to be a real positive constant.
 For the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

, this is the Bernoulli process, the ergodic process of random coin flips.
 This case is solvable, in that it is very well-explored, as a canonical
 model of ergodic behavior.
 The beta transformation is less-well studied; a full review of results
 is presented after this introduction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The periodic orbits of the beta transform can be characterized by quasi-cyclotom
ic polynomials; these are polynomials of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}-b_{0}z^{k}-b_{1}z^{k-1}-\cdots-b_{k-1}z-1$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}$
\end_inset

 being binary bits (zero or one).
 However, as always, the periodic orbits are a set of measure zero, and
 a fuller picture is obtained by studying the action of the map on distributions
 on the unit interval.
 Informally, this is given by the pushforward of the beta transform, acting
 on a distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\rho\right]\left(x\right)=\sum_{y\in t^{-1}\left(x\right)}\frac{\rho\left(y\right)}{\left|df/dx\right|_{y}}
\]

\end_inset

where the denominator is understood as the Jacobian determinant.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is a linear operator, acting on some space of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Different spaces result in different properties for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

; commonly explored are the polynomials, and the square-integrable functions,
 although in certain special cases, the analysis can be extended to highly
 singular, continuous-nowhere functions.
 The pushforward operator is generically called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfer operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ruelle–Frobenius–Perron operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The largest eigenvalue is conventionally called the Frobenius–Perron eigenvalue;
 it is usually equal to one.
 Solutions to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\mu=\mu$
\end_inset

 define an invariant measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 on the unit interval.
 It is invariant in the usual sense of dynamical systems: one has 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mu\circ t_{\beta}^{-1}\right)\left(x\right)=\mu\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 for almost all 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The proper formal statement of this is to invoke the sigma-algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 of Borel sets on the unit interval.
 The inverse of the beta transform is then a map 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\beta}^{-1}:\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 while the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is a sigma-additive measure.
 The pushforward nature of the transfer operator is now more readily visible:
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\rho=\rho\circ t_{\beta}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and one is interested in the eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L_{\beta}\rho=\lambda\rho}$
\end_inset

 of this operator, where the mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 is restricted in various ways, 
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 by limiting it to functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that can be interpreted as being polynomials, or square-integrable, 
\emph on
etc.

\emph default
 on the unit interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this section provides a very basic review of some elementary
 properties of the beta transform, starting with the full shift, aka the
 Bernoulli shift.
 The section is completed with a survey of other research results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bernoulli shift
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bernoulli shift (
\emph on
aka
\emph default
 the bit-shift map, the dyadic transform or the full shift) is an iterated
 map on the unit interval, given by iteration of the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b(x)=\begin{cases}
2x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
2x-1 & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:Bernoulli shift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The symbolic dynamics of this map gives the binary digit expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 That is, write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b^{n}(x)=(b\circ b\circ\cdots\circ b)(x)=b(b(\cdots b(x)\cdots))
\]

\end_inset

to denote the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-fold iteration of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{0}(x)=x$
\end_inset

.
 The symbolic dynamics is given by the bit-sequence
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b_{n}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{ if }0\le b^{n}(x)<\frac{1}{2}\\
1 & \mbox{ if }\frac{1}{2}\le b^{n}(x)\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:bernoulli-bits}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

(Attention: 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is a subscript on the left, and a superscript on the right! The left is
 a sequence, the right is an iteration.
 Using the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 one both sides is a convenient abuse of notation.) Of course, the symbolic
 dynamics recreates the initial real number:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_{n}\left(x\right)2^{-n-1}\label{eq:homomorphism}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

All of this is just a fancy way of saying that a real number can be written
 in terms of it's base-2 binary expansion.
 That is, the binary digits for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 are the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}=b_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bernoulli shift has many interesting properties, connecting it to the
 Cantor set and a large class of self-similar fractals.
 It is also connected to the modular group and elliptic functions (thence
 to number theory).
 It is also the primary example of an ergodic system, and, in a sense, has
 far-reaching implications for ergodic systems via Ornstein theory.
 These various connections are far too numerous to review here, beyond these
 breif mentions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current task is to attempt to see how many of these properties still
 hold in the more general case of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shift space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shift space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is formally defined to be a set of infinite sequences of a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 letters (or symbols), together with a shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 that takes each sequence, and lops off the left-most symbol.
 For the Bernoulli shift, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

 letters, taken from the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 For the Bernoulli shift, one is typically interested in the set of 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 possible infinite sequences: this is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

full shift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 One writes 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 for this shift space, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 denoting countable infinity.
 For the Bernoulli shift, the map 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is the shift operator: it just lops of the left-most symbol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, a shift space does not have to include every possible sequence
 of symbols; it does, however, by definition, have to be shift-invariant.
 That is, given some set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of infinite sequences of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 symbols, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a shift space if and only if, by loping off the leading symbol of each
 string, one regains 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 again.
 That is, a shift space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 must obey 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
TS=S
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\left\{ 000\cdots,111\cdots\right\} $
\end_inset

 contains only two elements: the string of all zeros, and the string of
 all ones; loping off the leading digit just returns 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 again.
 In general, shift spaces may contain a finite, or a countable, or an uncountabl
e number of elements.
 In general, one defines the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

full shift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the space 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 of all possible strings of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 symbols.
 Subsets that are shift spaces are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subshifts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

symbolic dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 also deserve some mention: given one specific sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in S$
\end_inset

 out of the shift space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, one can ponder 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where it goes to
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as one lops off a symbol at a time.
 This gives the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

symbolic dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the sequence.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

orbit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is defined as the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ T^{m}x\,|\,\mbox{integer }m\ge0\right\} $
\end_inset

 – that is, the set of all places that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 goes to.
 There are several possibilities: one is that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a fixed point, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $Tx=x$
\end_inset

.
 Another is that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a repeating sequence of symbols, in which case iteration repeats as
 well: 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{m}x=x$
\end_inset

 holds whenever the repeat length is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

; this is a periodic orbit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most importantly, when there are non-periodic orbits, then there are uncountaly
 many of them.
 That is, the number of periodic orbits is always countable: ther are at
 most 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 starting points for an orbit, and they are of at most length 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 This includes the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eventually periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 orbits: those that begin with some finite intial sequence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 moves, eventually settling into a periodic recurrance.
 This cannot be done for the non-periodic orbits: they cannot be placed
 in lexicographic order; as the Cantor slash argument applies.
 The non-periodic orbits are always uncountable.
 In this sense, the non-periodic orbits are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more important
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that the make up the bulk of all orbits.
 There are situations in which the periodic orbits can be said to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

govern
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the dynamics of the aperiodic ones; this is termed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coherent structure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However such concepts are advanced, and are not obviously applicable to
 the current situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In what follows, the text will in general confine itself to the uncountable
 case.
 Periodic orbits exist, but will be ignored; in a certain strict sense,
 they constitute a set of measure zero.
 A number of glosses like this will be made: for example, the real numbers,
 and the Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 are both uncountable; however, they are not in one-to-one correspondence,
 as some real numbers can have two different representations as bit sequences.
 Specifically, these are the dyadic fractions 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2n+1\right)/2^{m}$
\end_inset

 for positive integers 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n$
\end_inset

 – they can be validly represented by bit-sequences ending in all-zeros,
 or all-ones.
 There are only countably many such fractions; for the most part, this distincti
on between the real number line, and the Cantor space will be ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Beta shift
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta shift is similar to the Bernoulli shift, replacing the number 2
 by a constant real-number value 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta\le2$
\end_inset

.
 It can be defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\beta}(x)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:downshift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This map, together with similar maps, is illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Iterated-piece-wise-linear"

\end_inset

 below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as the Bernoulli shift generates a sequence of digits, so does the
 beta shift: write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
k_{n}=\begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{ if }0\le T_{\beta}^{n}(x)<\frac{1}{2}\\
1 & \mbox{ if }\frac{1}{2}\le T_{\beta}^{n}(x)\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:down-bits}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Given the symbolic dynamics, one can reconstruct the original value whenever
 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\frac{k_{0}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{1}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{2}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{3}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\cdots\right)\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

Written this way, the 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}(x)$
\end_inset

 clearly acts as a shift on this sequence:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}(x)=\frac{k_{1}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{2}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{3}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{4}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\cdots\right)\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

In this sense, this shift is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exactly solvable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the above provides a closed-form solution for iterating and un-iterating
 the sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiplying out the above sequence, one obtains the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, namely the series
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{1}{2}\,\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{k_{n}}{\beta^{n}}\label{eq:shift series}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, the bit-sequence that was extracted by iteration can be used to
 reconstruct the original real number.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

 in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bernoulli-bits"

\end_inset

 gives the Bernoulli shift: 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}\left(x\right)=b\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the Bernoulli shift, not every possible bit-sequence occurs in this
 system.
 It is a subshift of the full shift: it is a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 This is explored in greater detail in a later section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Associated polynomial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The iterated shift can also be written as a finite sum.
 This is noted here; it will be useful in later sections.
 Observe that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}(x)=\beta\left(x-\frac{k_{0}}{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{2}(x)=\beta^{2}x-\frac{\beta}{2}\left(\beta k_{0}+k_{1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{3}(x)=\beta^{3}x-\frac{\beta}{2}\left(\beta^{2}k_{0}+\beta k_{1}+k_{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The general form is then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\beta}^{p}(x)=\beta^{p}x-\frac{\beta}{2}\sum_{m=0}^{p-1}k_{m}\beta^{p-m-1}\label{eq:iterated shift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since the 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{m}$
\end_inset

 depend on both 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and are piece-wise discontinuous functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, this is not a true polynomial; however, this polynomial-like representation
 will be useful, later.

\begin_layout Subsection
Density Visualizations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

long-term dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift can be visualized by means of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bifurcation diagram
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Scare quotes are used, as these are imprecise terms; greater precision
 will be provided shortly.
 The idea of a bifurcation diagram was made famous by the Feigenbaum map
 (shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Logistic-Map-Bifurcation"

\end_inset

), and so the same idea is applied here: track orbits over long periods
 of time, and see where they go.
 This forms a density, which can be numerically explored by historgramming.
 This is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this is done for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift, one thing becomes immediately apparent: there are no actual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bifurcations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, no period-doubling regions, none of the stuff normally associated with
 the Feigenbaum map.
 Although there are periodic orbits, these form a set of measure zero: the
 iteration produces purely chaotic motion for almost all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>1$
\end_inset

.
 In this sense, the beta transform provides a clean form of

\begin_layout Standard
The visualization of the long-term dynamics is done by generating a histogram,
 and then taking the limit, as follows.
 One divides the unit interval into a fixed sequence of equal-sized bins;
 say a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 bins, so that each is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N$
\end_inset

 in width.
 Pick a starting 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and then iterate: if, at the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th iteration, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $j/N\le b_{\beta}^{n}(x)<(j+1)/N$
\end_inset

, then increment the count for the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

'th bin.
 After a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 iterations, let 
\begin_inset Formula $c(j;M)$
\end_inset

 be the count in the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

'th bin.
 This count is the histogram.
 In the limit of a large number of iterations, as well as small bin sizes,
 one obtains a distribution: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho(y;x)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\lim_{M\to\infty}\frac{c(j;M)}{M}\mbox{ for }\frac{j}{N}\le y<\frac{j+1}{N}
\]

\end_inset

This distribution depends on the initial value 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 chosen for the point to be iterated; a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nice
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 distribution results when one averages over all starting points:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho(y)=\int_{0}^{1}\rho(y;x)\,dx
\]

\end_inset

Numerically, this integration can be achieved by randomly sampling a large
 number of starting points.
 Observe that, by definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(y)$
\end_inset

 is a probability distribution:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1=\int_{0}^{1}\rho(x)\,dx
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probability distributions are the same thing as measures; they assign a
 density to each point on the unit interval.
 It can be shown that this particular distribution is invariant under iteration,
 and thus is often called the invariant measure, or sometimes the Haar measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

\begin_layout Subsection
Logistic Map
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The logistic map is related to the tent map, and is given by iteration of
 the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{\beta}\left(x\right)=2\beta x(1-x)
\]

\end_inset

It essentially replaces the triangle forming the tent map with a parabola
 of the same height.
 That is, the function is defined here so that the the same value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the same height for all three maps.
 Although the heights of the iterators have been aligned so that they match,
 each exhibits rather dramatically different dynamics.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform has a single fixed point for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<1$
\end_inset

, and then explodes into a fully chaotic regime above that.
 By contrast, the logistic map maintains a single fixed point up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=3/2$
\end_inset

, where it famously starts a series of period-doubling bifurcations.
 The onset of chaos is where the bifurcations come to a limit, at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=3.56995/2=1.784975$
\end_inset

.
 Within this chaotic region are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which do not appear in either the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform, or in the tent map.
 The tent map does show a period-doubling regime, but in this region, there
 are no fixed points: rather, the motion is chaotic, but confined to multiple
 arms.
 At any rate, the period doubling occurs at different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 than for the logistic map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bifurcation diagram is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Logistic-Map-Bifurcation"

\end_inset

.
 Again, it is worth closely examining the similarities between this, and
 the corresponding tent-map diagram, as well as the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform diagram.
 Naively, it would seem that the general structure of the chaotic regions
 are shared by all three maps.
 Thus, in order to understand chaos in the logistic map, it is perhaps easier
 to study it in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform.

 should be apparent, and one can pick out and find visually similar regions
 among these three illustrations.
 Formalizing this similarity is a bit harder, but it can be done: there
 is a way to make all three of these maps be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

topologically conjugate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to one-another.
 This is perhaps surprising, but is based on the observation that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the logistic map are countable, and are in one-to-one correspondence
 with certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trouble points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the iterated beta transformation.
 These are in turn in one-to-one correspondence with rational numbers.
 With a slight distortion of the beta transformation, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trouble points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be mapped to the islands of stability, in essentially the same way
 that phase locking regions (Arnold tongues) appear in the circle map.
 This is examined in a later section; it is mentioned here only to whet
 the appetite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Beta Transformation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After exactly one iteration of the beta shift, all initial points 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 are swept up into the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

, and never leave.
 Likewise, the range of the iterated beta-shift is 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, an alternative representation of the beta shift, filling the entire
 unit square, can be obtained by dividing both the domain and range by 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2$
\end_inset

 to obtain the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t_{\beta}(u)=\begin{cases}
\beta u & \mbox{ for }0\le u<\frac{1}{\beta}\\
\beta u-1 & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{\beta}\le u\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:beta transform}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This can be written more compactly as 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

.
 In this form, the function is named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the beta-transform
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, written as the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation, presenting a typesetting challenge to search engines when
 used in titles of papers.
 The orbit of a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in the beta-shift is identical to the orbit of a point 
\begin_inset Formula $u=2x/\beta$
\end_inset

 in the beta-transformation.
 Explicitly comparing to the beta-shift of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\beta}^{n}\left(x\right)=\frac{\beta}{2}t_{\beta}^{n}\left(\frac{2x}{\beta}\right)\label{eq:xform-shift equivalence}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The beta-shift and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation are essentially 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the same function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; this text works almost exclusively with the beta-shift, and is thus idiosyncra
tic, as it flouts the more common convention of working with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation.
 The primary reasonfor doing this is to retain contact with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift being a subshift of the full shift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a single iteration of the tent map, a similar situation applies.
 After one iteration, all initial points 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 are swept up into the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 After a finite number of iterations, all points 
\begin_inset Formula $0<x\le\beta\left(1-\beta/2\right)$
\end_inset

 are swept up, so that the remaining iteration takes place on the domain
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\left(1-\beta/2\right)<x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 It is worth defining a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sidetent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function, which corresponds to the that part of the tent map in which iteration
 is confined.
 It is nothing more than a rescaling of the tent map, ignoring those parts
 outside of the above domain that wander away.
 The sidetent is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{\beta}(u)=\begin{cases}
\beta\left(u-1\right)+2 & \mbox{ for }0\le u<\frac{\beta-1}{\beta}\\
\beta\left(1-u\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{\beta-1}{\beta}\le u\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

Performing a left-right flip on the side-tent brings it closer in form to
 the beta-transformation.
 The flipped version, replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $u\to1-u$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{\beta}(u)=\begin{cases}
\beta u & \mbox{ for }0\le u<\frac{1}{\beta}\\
2-\beta u & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{\beta}\le u\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tent map (and the flipped tent) exhibits fixed points (periodic orbits;
 mode-locking) for the smaller values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 These can be eliminated by shifting part of the tent downwards, so that
 the diagonal is never intersected.
 This suggests the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sidetarp
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{\beta}(u)=\begin{cases}

The beta shift map, shown in the upper left, generates orbits that spend
 all of their time in the shaded area: a box of size 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{2}\times\frac{\beta}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Enlarging this box to the unit square gives the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation.
 The tent map resembles the beta shift, except that one arm is flipped to
 make a tent-shape.
 After a finite number of iterations, orbits move entirely in the shaded
 region; enlarging this region to be the unit square gives the sidetent
 map.
 Flipping it left-right gives the fliptent map.
 Although it is not trivially obvious, the fliptent map and the sidetent
 map have the same orbits, and thus the same bifurcation diagram.

The bottom three maps all have fixed points and periodic orbits, essentially

; they are merely rearrangents of the same basic elements.

 Understanding this avoids the need for weasel-words and imprecise hand-waving
 when making claims and statements; common phrases can be given a precise
 meaning.
 This section reviews textbook-standard material; it is included here only
 to allow this text to be self-contained.

\begin_layout Standard
The Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 can be given a topology, the product topology.
 The open sets of this topology are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cylinder sets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These are strings in three symbols: a finite number of 0 and 1 symbols,
 and an infinite number of * symbols, the latter meaning 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

don't care
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Set union is defined location-by-location, with 
\begin_inset Formula $0\cup*=1\cup*=*$
\end_inset

 and set intersection as 
\begin_inset Formula $0\cap*=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\cap*=1$
\end_inset

.
 Set complement exchanges 0 and 1 and leaves * alone: 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{0}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{*}=*$
\end_inset

.
 The topology is then the collection of all cylinder sets.
 Note that the intersection of any finite number of cylinder sets is still
 a cylinder set, as is the union of an infinite number of them.
 The product topology does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 contain any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: strings consisting solely of just 0 and 1 are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 allowed in the topology.
 By definition, topologies only allow finite intersections, and thus don't
 provide any way of constructing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Of course, points can always be added 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

by hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but doing so tends to generate a topology that is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too fine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; in particular, the common-sense notions of a continuous function are ruined
 by fine topologies.
 The product topology is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coarse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Borel algebra, or sigma-algebra, takes the topology and also allows
 set complement.
 This effectively changes nothing, as the open sets are still the cylinder
 sets, although now they are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clopen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as they are both closed and open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denote the Borel algebra by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 A shift is now a map 
\begin_inset Formula $T:\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 that lops off the leading symbol of a given cylinder set (XXX FIXME lop
 off only for full shift!).
 This is provides the strong theoretical advantages over working with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: confusions about counting points and orbits and defining densities go
 away.
 This is done by recasting discussion in terms of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 from Borel sets to the reals (or the complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 or other fields, when this is interesting).
 An important class of such functions are the measures.
 These are functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 that are positive, and are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compatible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the sigma algebra, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(A\cup B\right)=\mu\left(A\right)+\mu\left(B\right)$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cap B=\varnothing$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(A\cap B\right)=\mu\left(A\right)\mu\left(B\right)$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 For the total space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 (here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is the Cantor space), one case 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\Omega\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prototypical example of a measure is the Bernoulli measure, which assigns
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to any string containing a single 0 and the rest all *'s.
 By complement, a string containing a single 1 and the rest all *'s has
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-p$
\end_inset

.
 The rest follows from the sigma algebra: a cylinder set consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 zeros and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 ones has measure 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{m}\left(1-p\right)^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 It is usually convenient to take 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1/2$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; the Bernoulli process is a sequence of coin tosses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The map given in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is a homomorphism from the Cantor space to the unit interval.
 It extends naturally to a map from the Borel algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 to the algebra of intervals on the unit interval.
 It is not an isomorphism: cylinder sets are both open and closed, whereas
 intervals on the real number line are either open, or closed (or half-open).
 It is convenient to take the map as a map to closed intervals, so that
 it's a surjection onto the reals, although usually, this detail does not
 matter.
 What does matter is of one takes 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1/2$
\end_inset

, then the Bernoulli measure is preserved: it is mapped onto the conventional
 measure on the real-number line.
 Thus, the cylinder set 
\begin_inset Formula $0***\cdots$
\end_inset

 is mapped to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1/2\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1***\cdots$
\end_inset

 is mapped to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1/2,1\right]$
\end_inset

 and both have a measure of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 and this extends likewise to all intersections and unions.
 Points have a measure of zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the map of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is not an isomorphism, it is more-or-less safe form most practical purposes
 to treat it as such.
 For any closed interval, there is a unique corresponding cylinder set.
 The only trouble arises at points: all dyadic rationals have two expansions
 not one, and so there, the map is not invertable.
 However, the points all have a measure of zero in both cases, and there
 are only a countable number of such points, and the mapping always takes
 points to points.
 Thus, the inverse exists for almost all members of the algebra and is unique
 whenever an interval has positive measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much of what is said above still holds for subshifts.
 Recall, a subshift 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $S\subset\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the shift 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $TS=S$
\end_inset

.
 The space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 inherits a topology from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

, this is the subspace topology.
 The Borel algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 is similarly defined, as are measures.
 One can now (finally!) give a precise definition for an invariant measure:
 it is a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\circ T^{-1}=\mu$
\end_inset

, or more precisely, for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(T^{-1}\left(\sigma\right)\right)=\mu\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 for almost all cylinder sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 This is what shift invariance looks like.
 Note carefully that 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and not 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is used in the definition.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is a surjection while 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is not: every cylinder set 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 in the subshift 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

came from somewhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; we want to define invariance for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and not just for some of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is technically called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pushforward
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and it defines a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 on the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 of all functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 It is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:\mathcal{F\to\mathcal{F}}$
\end_inset

 by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:f\mapsto f\circ T^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 It is obviously linear, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(af+bg\right)=a\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(f\right)+b\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(g\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This pushforward is canonically called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfer operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Like any linear operator, it has a spectrum.
 The precise spectrum depends on the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The canonical example is again the Bernoulli shift.
 For this, we invoke the inverse of the mapping of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is a function defined on the unit interval, instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is the space of real-analytic functions on the unit interval, that is,
 the space all power series in 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

, then the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 is discrete.
 It consists of the Bernoulli polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 and have a corresponding eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-n}$
\end_inset

.
 That is,
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}B_{n}=2^{-n}B_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{0}\left(x\right)=1$
\end_inset

 is the invariant measure on the full shift.
 For the space of square-integrable functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

, the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 is continuous, and consists of the unit disk in the complex plane; the
 corresponding eigenfunctions are fractal.
 Even more interesting constructions are possible; the Minkowski question
 mark function provides an example of a measure on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the shift defined by the Gauss map 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(x\right)\mapsto\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

.
 That is, as a measure, it solves 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}?^{\prime}=?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset

 the Minkowski question mark function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 it's derivative; note that the derivative is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continuous nowhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This rather confusing idea can be completely dispelled by observing that
 it is well-defined on all cylinder sets in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 and is finite on all of them – not only finite, but less than one, as any
 good measure must obey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These last examples are mentioned so as to reinforce the idea working with
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 instead of the unit interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 really does offer some strong conceptual advantages.
 They also reinforce the idea that the Bernoulli shift is not the only 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

full shift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (besides the question-mark function, there is also the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 In the following text, we will be working with subshifts, primarily the
 beta-shift, but will draw on ideas from the above so as to make rigorous
 statements about measureability and invariance, without having to descend
 into either 
\emph on

 hand-waving or provide painfully difficult (and confusing) reasoning about
 subsets of the real-number line.

Similar to the way in which a dyadic rational

 has two different binary expansions, one ending in all-zeros, and a second
 ending in all-ones, so one may also ask if and when a real number

 might have more than one

The space of all possible sequences of binary digits is termed the Cantor
 set.
 It is the Cartesian product of infinitely many copies of the set containing

 from the natural topology on the real-number line.

Given that iteration can generate strings of binary digits, and that these
 can be reassembled back into real numbers, it is interesting to ask what
 those mappings look like.
 To firm up the notation, let 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\left(b_{n}\right)=\left(b_{0},b_{1,},\cdots\right)$

 denote a sequence of bits (or symbols) and write
\end_layout

\end_inset

as the real number generated from that sequence.
 Conversely, given a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, let 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\left(k_{n;\beta}\left(x\right)\right)$

 denote the sequence of bits obtained by iterating the beta shift on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

The two functions are adjoint; specifically, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\left(\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(y\right)\right)=y$
\end_inset

 for almost all 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 but that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\left(y\right)\right)\ne y$
\end_inset

.
 The former relation is equivalent to eqn.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:shift series"

\end_inset

.
 Not all possible sequences of bit strings appear in the beta shift sequence
 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\beta}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

; that is, this function is not a surjection onto 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 This manifests itself as the gaps in the range of the compressor function,
 clearly visible in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Compressor-Function"

\end_inset

.
 If a sequence of bits is viewed as a sequence of left-right moves walking
 down a binary tree, this implies that some branches of the tree are never
 taken, and can be pruned.
 Only branches on the right are ever pruned: That is, there can be arbitrarily
 long sequences of zeros in the expansion, but the longest possible sequence
 of 1's is always bounded.
 The longest run of 1's possible is the largest value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 that satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
2\ge\frac{1+\beta+\beta^{2}+\cdots\beta^{n-1}}{\beta^{n-1}}
\]

\end_inset

Solving, the bound is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
n=1+\left\lfloor \frac{-\log\left(2-\beta\right)}{\log\beta}\right\rfloor \label{eq:longest-all-ones}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, every 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th right branch is pruned from the binary tree.
 For example, a run of three 1's in a row is possible only for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\ge\left(1+\sqrt{5}\right)/2=1.618034\cdots$
\end_inset

 the Golden Ratio.
 The range of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

 is most of, but not all of the Cantor set.

This figure illustrates a color coded visualization of the range of the
 compressor function.
 As before 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 varies from 0 at the bottom to 2 at the top, and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 varies from 0 on the left to 1 on the right.
 In general, the compressor function maps intervals of the real number line
 to single points; the color corresponds to the size (the measure) of the
 intervals that were mapped to that particular point.
 Blue corresponds to a compression of the measure by about 1, green to a
 compression of about 2-3, and yellow-red to a compression greater than
 that.

Self-similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subshifts are, by definition, self-similar.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a subshift, and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the shift operator, then 
\begin_inset Formula $TS=S$
\end_inset

 is the key relation obeyed by a subshift.
 It is fun to see how this actually manifests itself on the unit interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the two functions cpr and pdr are self-similar.
 The pdr function demonstrates classic period doubling self-similarity:
 namely, under 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)=x/2$
\end_inset

, it behaves as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\circ g\right)\left(x\right)=\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

while under reflection 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x)=1-x$
\end_inset

, it behaves as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\circ r\right)\left(x\right)=\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\left(1-x\right)=\frac{\beta}{2\left(\beta-1\right)}-\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{x\to1}\,\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\frac{\beta}{2\left(\beta-1\right)}
\]

\end_inset

The full dyadic monoid is generated by the generators 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 It consists of all finite-length strings of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}rg^{a_{3}}r\cdots rg^{a_{m}}
\]

\end_inset

for a finite-length list of positive integers 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3,}\cdots,a_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Note that this list can be interpreted as a continued fraction; this establishe
s an isomorphism between the continued fractions and the dyadic monoid.
 This isomorphism is conventionally called the Minkowski question-mark function.
 We can be a bit more explicit.
 Write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\frac{x}{\beta}
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\frac{\beta}{2\left(\beta-1\right)}-x
\]

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\beta}\circ r_{\beta}=1$
\end_inset

 so that it is a reflection, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}\left(x\right)=1-x$
\end_inset

 is the reflection of the unit interval.
 For strings of binary digits, the reflection performs the exchange of 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leftrightarrow1$
\end_inset

; its a mirroring symmetry.
 The above relationships then become
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{\beta}\circ\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}=\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\circ g_{2}
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{\beta}\circ\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}=\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\circ r_{2}
\]

\end_inset

The symmetry under the dyadic monoid is simply the statement that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma_{\beta}\circ\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}=\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\circ\gamma_{2}
\]

\end_inset

for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 of the above form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The function cpr also exhibits self-similarity, although it alters (expands)
 what happens on the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 axis.
 Several self-similarities are apparent.
 First, for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1$
\end_inset

, one has
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{\beta x}{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Equivalently, for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le y\le\beta/2$
\end_inset

 one can trivially restate the above as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(y\right)\label{eq:compressor self-sim}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Although this follows trivially, this restatement helps avoid certain confusions
 later in this text.
 This can also be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{2}\circ\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}=\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\circ g_{\beta}
\]

\end_inset

There is obviously no corresponding reflection symmetry.
 The left and right halves are identical to one-another, but offset: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}+\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

It follows that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{y}{\beta}\right)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(y\right)
\]

\end_inset

Combining the above results into one, one has that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{y}{\beta}\right)=\frac{1}{2}+\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(y\right)
\]

\end_inset

This last form is interesting, as it makes an appearance in relation to
 the transfer operator, defined below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other things with similar symmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cpr curve is just one that belongs to a class of such curves.
 As an example, one may construct a Takagi (blancmange) curve by iterating
 triangles whose peak is located at 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

.
 The Takagi curve is an example of a curve transforming under a 3-dimensional
 representation of the dyadic monoid; the cpr curves transforms under a
 two-dimensional representation.
 See my paper on the Takagi curve for details.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Skew-Takagi-Curve"

\end_inset

 shows such a curve.
 Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{tak}_{\beta;w}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

a curve constructed in this fashion.
 The transformation properties of this curve include self-similarity on
 the left, as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{tak}_{\beta;w}\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)=x+w\;\mbox{tak}_{\beta;w}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 and self-similarity on the right, as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{tak}_{\beta;w}\left(\frac{1}{\beta}+x\left(1-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\right)=1-x+w\;\mbox{tak}_{\beta;w}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

Both of these properties follow directly from the construction of the curve;
 they can be taken as the defining equations for the curve.
 That is, the curve can be taken as that function which satisfies these
 two recursion relations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The derivative of the skew Takagi curve is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Skew-Haar-Wavelet"

\end_inset

, and, for lack of a better name, could be called the skew Haar fractal
 wavelet.
 It can be defined as the formal derivative
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{har}_{\beta;w}\left(x\right)=\frac{d}{dx}\,\mbox{tak}_{\beta;w}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

This formal derivative is well-defined, as the skew Takagi is smooth and
 piecewise-linear almost everywhere; the places where it has corners is
 a dense set of measure zero.
 That is, the derivative is defined everywhere, except on a set of measure
 zero, which happens to be dense in the unit interval.

\begin_layout Section
Transfer operators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discovery and study of invariant measures, as well as of decaying states
 can be approached via the transfer operator, or, properly named, the Ruelle-Fro
benius-Perron operator.
 This is an operator that captures the behavior of a distribution under
 the action of a map.
 The invariant measure is an eigenstate of this operator; indeed, it provides
 a formal definition for what it means to be invariant under the action
 of the map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given an iterated map 
\begin_inset Formula $g:[0,1]\to[0,1]$
\end_inset

 on the unit interval, the transfer operator defines how distributions are
 acted on by this map.
 It is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{g}f\right]\left(y\right)=\sum_{x=g^{-1}(y)}\frac{f(x)}{\left|g^{\prime}(x)\right|}
\]

\end_inset

The left adjoint of the transfer operator is the composition operator (Koopman
 operator).
 This is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{C}_{g}f\right]\left(y\right)=f\left(g\left(y\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

The Koopman operator is adjoint, in the sense that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}\mathcal{C}_{g}=1$
\end_inset

 but that, in general, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{g}\mathcal{L}_{g}\ne1$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The transfer operator for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform are only superficially different.
 We'll give both of them here, as it is sometimes useful to reference one
 or the other, depending on the situation.
 Superficially, they seem to have a different form, but are in the end just
 scaled versions of one-another.
 The transfer operator the beta-shift map 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}(x)$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}f\right]\left(y\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right] & \mbox{ for }0\le y\le\beta/2\\
0 & \mbox{ for }\beta/2<y\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

or, written more compactly
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-y\right)\label{eq:xfer oper}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta$
\end_inset

 is the Heaviside step function.
 The transfer operator for the beta-transform map 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\beta}(x)$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{M}_{\beta}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right)\right]

\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(y\right)=\frac{2}{\beta}\nu_{\beta}\left(\frac{2y}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-y\right)$
\end_inset

; the two invariant measures are just scaled copies of one-another.
 Both are normalized so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\rho\left(y\right)dy=\int_{0}^{1}\nu_{\beta}\left(y\right)dy=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both of these invariant measures are the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron (RFP) eigenfunc
tions of the corresponding operators, as they correspond to the largest
 eigenvalues of the transfer operators, in each case being the eigenvalue
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generally, one is interested in characterizing the eigenspectrum
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

for eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|\le1$
\end_inset

 and eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(y)$
\end_inset

 Solving this equation requires choosing a space of functions in which to
 work.
 Natural choices include any of the Banach spaces, and in particular, the
 space of square-integrable functions.
 Particularly interesting is the space of almost-smooth functions, those
 having discontinuities at only a countable number of locations, but otherwise
 being infinitely differentiable.
 Although the discussion so far implicitly conditions one to restrict oneself
 to real-valued functions, and to consider only real-valued eigenvalues,
 this is perhaps too sharp a restriction.
 It will become clear in the following chapters that even the most basic
 form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 has a complex-valued spectrum.
 At any rate, it should be obvious that, whatever the choice of function
 space, one must have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(y\right)=0$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<2y$
\end_inset

.
 This turns out to be a rather harsh condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At least one basic fact is known: for at least some kinds of function spaces,
 the RFP eigenfunction is given by Gel'fond and Parry, as shown in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invariant measure"

\end_inset

.
 More precisely, it is just the rescaled form 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(x\right)=\nu\left(2x/\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

 and zero otherwise.
 Changing vocabulary, this is sometimes called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

invariant measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; as it describes a measure on the unit interval.
 That is, for the space of all possible measures on the unit interval, the
 Gel'fond-Parry measure is one of the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator.
 Some caution is advised here: for the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

, that is, the Bernoulli shift, one has as an eigenfunction the Minkowski
 measure
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-mink2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

; it has eigenvalue 1, but is otherwise quite pathological: it is continuous
 nowhere, zero on the rationals, and divergent on the rest (i.e.
 on a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cantor set).
 There's no particular reason to think that this holds only for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

; measures can be, in general, very unusual functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A very minor simplification can be achieved with a change of variable.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\frac{\beta}{2}-\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 Then the eigenequation becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda\beta\rho\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-\epsilon\right)=\rho\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\epsilon}{\beta}\right)+\rho\left(1-\frac{\epsilon}{\beta}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The second term vanishes whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2<1-\epsilon/\beta$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon<\beta(1-\beta/2)$
\end_inset

 and so one has the simpler recurrence relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda\rho\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\rho\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)\label{eq:eigen-branch}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(\beta-1)<2y\le\beta$
\end_inset

.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 can be treated as recurrence relations, defining the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

 eigenstate.
 Recursing on these gives exactly the densities shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Undershift-Density-Distribution"

\end_inset

.
 Computationally, these are much, much cheaper to compute, at least for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 much larger than 1, although convergence issues present themselves as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 approaches 1.
 The resulting density may be called the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron eigenstate;
 because it can be quickly computed, it provides an alternative view of
 figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Undershift-Density-Distribution"

 Unfortunately, I find the Russian original of Gelfond's article unreadable,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest route seems to be direct verification that eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invariant measure"

\end_inset

 is correct, as opposed to a derivation of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invariant measure"

\end_inset

 from first principles.
 This is done below, explicitly showing all steps in laborious detail.
 It's not at all difficult; just a bit hard on the eyes.
 As before, let 
\begin_inset Formula $t\left(x\right)\equiv t_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

 be the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:beta transform"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 the iterated transformation.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta(x)$
\end_inset

 be the Heaviside step function as always, and to keep notation breif, let
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}\equiv t^{n}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The Gelfond-Parry measure is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nu\left(y\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Theta\left(t_{n}-y\right)}{\beta^{n}}
\]

\end_inset

where it is more convenient to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{n}\left(y\right)=\Theta\left(t_{n}-y\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The transfer operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 for the beta-transformation is slightly more convenient to work with than
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 for this particular case.
 It is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{M}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y+1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

and we wish to verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}\nu=\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Plugging in directly,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P=\nu\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+\nu\left(\frac{y+1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right) & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{y+1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right)\right)\\
 & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-y\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1-y\right)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta\left(ax\right)=\Theta\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 for all constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, and since 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}\le1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 These terms simplify, depending on whether 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset

 is small or large.
 Explicitly, one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1-y\right)=0 & \mbox{ if }\beta t_{n}-1<0\\
\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-y\right)=1 & \mbox{ if }\beta t_{n}-1>0
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(1-\beta t_{n}\right)\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-y\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\left(1+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1-y\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

These can be collapsed by noting that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\beta t_{n}=t_{n+1} & \mbox{ if }\beta t_{n}-1<0\\
\beta t_{n}-1=t_{n+1} & \mbox{ if }\beta t_{n}-1>0
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(1-\beta t_{n}\right)\Theta\left(t_{n+1}-y\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\left(1+\Theta\left(t_{n+1}-y\right)\right)\right)\\
 & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(t_{n+1}-y\right)\left[\Theta\left(1-\beta t_{n}\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\right]+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\right)\\
 & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(t_{n+1}-y\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\right)\\
 & =\beta\nu\left(y\right)-\beta+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)}{\beta^{n}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The last sum on the right is just the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion for 1.
 That is, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Theta\left(\beta t^{n}\left(x\right)-1\right)}{\beta^{n+1}}
\]

\end_inset

This is just eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:shift series"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 written in a different way (making use of the equivalence 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:xform-shift equivalence"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $P=\beta\nu\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}\nu=\nu$
\end_inset

 as claimed.

 No changes are required, and the result can be read off directly:
\begin_inset Formula

\left[\mathcal{M}\nu_{\beta;z}\right]\left(y\right) & =\frac{\nu_{\beta;z}\left(y\right)}{z}-\frac{1}{z}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^{n}\frac{\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)}{\beta^{n+1}}\\
 & =\frac{\nu_{\beta;z}\left(y\right)}{z}+C\left(\beta;z\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(\beta;z\right)$
\end_inset

 being a constant independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 If there are values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

 at which 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(\beta;z\right)=0$

\begin_layout Standard

\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 are exactly the same digits as defined by Parry, just rescaled for the
 beta-shift.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{n}\left(x\right)=\varepsilon_{n}\left(\frac{2x}{\beta}\right)=\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}t_{n}-x\right)=\Theta\left(T^{n}\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)-x\right)=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{if }x<T^{n}\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)\\
0 & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:xform-shift equivalence"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 is used.
 The iterated end-point becomes the iterated midpoint:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t^{n}\left(1\right)=\frac{2}{\beta}T^{n}\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Holding both 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 fixed, the summation is clearly convergent (and holomorphic in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

) for complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 within the disk 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<\beta$
\end_inset

.
 The eigenequation has the same form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}v_{\beta;z}\right]\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{z}v_{\beta;z}\left(x\right)+C\left(\beta;z\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(\beta;z\right)$
\end_inset

 is a constant independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Numeric verification reveals we were a bit glib: 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(\beta;z\right)$
\end_inset

 is a constant for 
\begin_inset Formula $x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

 and is zero otherwise!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interesting limit is where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|\to\beta$
\end_inset

 and so its convenient to re-express 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=z/\beta$
\end_inset

.
 With some rearrangements, one obtains
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(\beta;\zeta\right)\equiv\zeta\beta C\left(\beta;\zeta\beta\right)=-1+\zeta\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}d_{n}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\label{eq:holomorphic-disk}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is a straight-forward sum to examine numerically; the disk is readily
 plotted, and reveals what looks like a countable number of zeros in the
 disk 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right|<1$
\end_inset

, and then many more in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right|\to1$
\end_inset

.
 Each zero corresponds to an eigenfunction/eigenvalue pair, the eigenfunction
 given by eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:coherent-first-order"

\end_inset

.
 The table below lists some examples; the numbers are accurate to about
 the last decimal place.

Replacing

This is holomorphic on the unit disk 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right|<1$

 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}\left(y\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $y>\beta/2$
\end_inset

, and so one may pull out the step function to write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(\beta;\zeta\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}\left[\zeta d_{n}\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+\zeta d_{n}\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)-d_{n}\left(y\right)\right]\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-y\right)
\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;\zeta\right)$

 Setting

Staring at the right-hand side of the sum above, it is hardly obvious that

 Copying equation

The iterations are running in opposite directions; this is as appropriate,
 since the the transfer operator was a push-forward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful here to return to the language of cylinder sets, as opposed
 to point dynamics.
 Recall that the Borel algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 was defined as the sigma algebra, the collection of all cylinder sets in
 theproduct topology of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 A shift is a map 
\begin_inset Formula $T:\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 that lops off the leading symbol of a given cylinder set.
 The inverted map 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is a pushforward, in that it defines the transfer operator, a linear operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:\mathcal{F\to\mathcal{F}}$
\end_inset

 on the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 of all functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

; explicitly, it is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:f\mapsto f\circ T^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Insofar as the 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 arose in the exploration of the transfer operator, it is not surprising
 that the shift is acting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

backwards
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with point dynamics is that one cannot meaningfully write 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 for a real number, a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, at least, not without sever contortions that lead back to the Borel algebra.
 Not for lack of trying; the 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Julia set
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (to order 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

) of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

: it is the preimage, the set of all points that, when iterated, converge
 onto 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can the analytic relation be restated in terms of cylinder sets? Yes, and
 it follows in a fairly natural way.
 The first step is to extend 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 to a map 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}:\mathcal{B}\to\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathcal{B}\to\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 be the Bernoulli meaure.
 Using the Bernoulli mapping 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,T^{n}\left(\beta/2\right)\right]$
\end_inset

 maps to some cylinder; call it 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, given some cylinder 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

, define
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{n}\left(A\right)=\mu\left(A\cap\Delta_{n}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The rotated (pre-)measure is extended likewise: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nu\left(A\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}d_{n}\left(A\right)
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=z/\beta$
\end_inset

 as before, recovering the Parry measure by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

.
 The Parry measure should be invariant under the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}:\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

, and otherwise yeild eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's check.
 The proof will mirror the one of the previous section.
 Here, it is convenient to use the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 instead of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is dissipative: a portion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 wanders away, and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is not defined on all of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

; it is only defined on the subshift.
 By contrast 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is defined on all of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

; this simplifies the proof.
 Otherwise, the same notation is used, but rescaled, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the cylinder corresponding to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,t^{n}\left(1\right)\right]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that for every 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 and every 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in A$
\end_inset

, one will find that 
\begin_inset Formula $y/\beta\in t^{-1}\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

 and, whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $y\le\beta-1$
\end_inset

 that also 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(y+1\right)/\beta\in t^{-1}\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{-1}\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

 naturally splits into two parts: the cylinder that maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1/\beta\right]$
\end_inset

, call it 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 and the complement 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{D}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pushfoward action is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\nu\left(t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)\\
= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}\left[\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap D\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)+\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap\overline{D}\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Two distinct cases emerge.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{n}\left(1\right)<1/\beta$
\end_inset

 then one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{n}\cap\overline{D}=\varnothing$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the second term can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap\overline{D}\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right) & =\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap\overline{D}\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)\\
 & =\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\frac{1}{\beta}\mu\left(\Delta_{n+1}\cap A\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where the second line follows from the first by linearity, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{D}$
\end_inset

 selected out one of the two branches of 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{-1}\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Meanwhile, when 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{n}\left(1\right)>1/\beta$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $D\subset\Delta_{n}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $D\cap\Delta_{n}=D$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the first term splits into two: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap D\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right) & =\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\mu\left(D\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)\\
 & =\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\frac{1}{\beta}\mu\left(A\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

while
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\beta}-t_{n}\right)\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap D\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)=\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\beta}-t_{n}\right)\frac{1}{\beta}\mu\left(\Delta_{n+1}\cap A\right)
\]

\end_inset

Reassembling these pieces and making use of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{0}\cap A=A$
\end_inset

 one gets
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\nu\left(t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right) & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\zeta^{n}}{\beta}\left[\mu\left(A\right)\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)+\mu\left(\Delta_{n+1}\cap A\right)\right]\\
 & =\frac{1}{z}\nu\left(A\right)-\frac{\mu\left(A\right)}{z}+\mu\left(A\right)\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\zeta^{n}}{\beta}\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\\
 & =\frac{1}{z}\nu\left(A\right)+\frac{\mu\left(A\right)}{z}E\left(\beta;z\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with the constant term as before, in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:holomorphic-disk"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
E\left(\beta;z\right) & =-1+\zeta\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\\
 & =-1+\zeta\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}d_{n}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

As before, one has for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;1\right)=0$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\circ t^{-1}=\nu$
\end_inset

 is indeed the measure invariant under 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Other eigenvalues can be found for those values of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;z\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 The task at hand is then to characterize 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;z\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $m_{n}=T_{\beta}^{n}\left(\beta/2\right)$
\end_inset

 is ergodic in the unit interval, for almost all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 However, for certain values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, the midpoint iterates will hit the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift map has a discontinuity.
 Here, iteration stops: at the next step, this point is defined to iterate
 to zero, in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

.
 Zero is a fixed point, and so there is nowhere further to go.
 This section explores these special values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from the definition in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

, one can consider the modified map, where the less-than sign has been altered
 to a less-than-or-equals:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{\le}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0\le x\le\frac{1}{2}\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}<x\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

In this map, the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

 iterates to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2$
\end_inset

, which is just the initial midpoint itself.
 In this case, the halted orbits become periodic orbits.
 There is a third possibility, to simply remove the points 0, 1 and 1/2
 from the domain:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{<}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0<x<\frac{1}{2}\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}<x<1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

In this case, if the midpoint iterates to 1/2, it can be taken to simply
 have wandered out of the domain of validity.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wander
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used here in the technical sense: The map 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is dissipative in two different senses: first, in the obvious sense, the
 points 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2<x$
\end_inset

 wander away after exactly one iteration; secondly, the mid-point iterates
 wander down to zero, never to return, unless they are made explicitly periodic
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}^{\le}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.

 of the three variants, in the strict topological sense of a quotient space.
 Thus, interestingly, for the beta shift, the periodic orbits and the fixed
 point both belong to the same equivalence class.
 This has some interesting implications when one compares the beta shift
 to other iterated maps, such as the logistic map, which have non-trivial
 stable regions.
 Topologically, it would seem that one can perform a kind of surgery, attaching
 stable regions exactly into those spots where, in the beta shift, one has
 an equivalence class.
 This solves (at least for me) the long-standing problem of exactly how
 to properly describe the topological conjugacy between different kinds
 of iterated maps.

 being disallowed, as it already lead to a termination of midpoint iteration.
 The midpoint

 That is, trouble spots arise on a pruned binary tree: one generally expects
 new spots to occur on the left and right of the immediate predecessor,

This appears to be Sloane's OEIS A001037 which has a number of known relationshi
ps to roots of unity, Lyndon words, and the number of orbits in the tent
 map.
 The trouble spots are the positive real roots of polynomials of the form
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{\left\{ b_{k}\right\} }\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{n}-\beta^{n-1}-b_{1}\beta^{n-2}-b_{2}\beta^{n-3}-\cdots-1=0
\]

\end_inset

with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 being certain binary bit sequences.
 There is just one such (positive, real) root for each such polynomial.
 These polynomials are relatively prime, in the sense that a bit-sequence
 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

 is disallowed if it has the same root as some lower-order polynomial.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{4}-\beta^{3}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

 is disallowed; it has the same root as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{2}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

.
 Equivalently, the quadratic is a factor of the quartic; the quartic is
 not relatively prime with respect to the quadratic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the digits 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

 must be zero or one, this definition of irreducibility, plus the counting,
 suggests some relationship to the irreducible polynomials over the field
 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\mathbb{F}}_{2}$
\end_inset

, as that is what the definition of OEIS A001037 counts.
 Yet the relationship, if any, is quite unclear.

A hypothesis presented in a later section suggests that each orbit should
 be thought of as a Galois group, with the length of the orbit corresponding
 to the number of elements in the Galois group.

The values of 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{n}$
\end_inset

 are given explicitly by Moreau's necklace-counting function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{d|n}2^{d}\mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where the sum runs over all integers 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 that divide 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is the Möbius function.
 The generating function is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{t}{\frac{1}{2}-t}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}nM_{n}\frac{t^{n}}{1-t^{n}}
\]

\end_inset

which has a radius of convergence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|t\right|<1/2$
\end_inset

.
 For large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the asymptotic behavior can be trivially deduced from the defining sum:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{n}=\frac{2^{n}}{n}-\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{2^{n/2}}{n}\right)
\]

The above counting function is for necklaces with only two colors.
 In general, one can have necklaces with 3 or more colors; can that happen
 here? Yes, of course: if one considers the general 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform for 
\begin_inset Formula $2<\beta$
\end_inset

, then, in general, it can be taken as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

kneading transform
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lceil \beta\right\rceil $
\end_inset

 branches or folds in it.
 The analogous trouble-spots again appear, and they can appear after an
 arbitrary finite-length orbit.
 Insofar as they correspond to periodic orbits, they are necessarily counted
 by the necklace-counting function.
 That is, one must consider all possible strings of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lceil \beta\right\rceil $
\end_inset

 letters, modulo a cyclic permutation: this is the very definition of a
 necklace (or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

circular word
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The number of such necklaces is given by the necklace-counting function.
 Each such orbit is necessarily represented by a Lyndon word, which is a
 representative of the conjugacy class of the orbit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apparently, the isomorphism problem for OEIS A001037 is a generic issue:
 the number of irreducible polynomials over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{p}$
\end_inset

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 prime, is the same as the number of necklaces, and yet, there is no known
 bijection between these irreducible polynomials and the Lyndon words!

 Because of the piece-wise linear form of

 It can perhaps be more easily understood by studying the location of the

Thus, for example, the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{3}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

 is excluded from the list simply because it is not an iterate of an earlier

, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 The numbering scheme does not even have a way of numbering this particular

 Despite this, the silver constant does appear, but a bit later, as the

, which is an allowed polynomial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{5}=\beta^{4}-\beta^{3}-\beta-1$

 is excluded because it has 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi=1.618\cdots$
\end_inset

 as a root, which was previously observed by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{9}=\beta^{5}-\beta^{4}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

 is excluded because it's root, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{9}=1.497094048762796\cdots$
\end_inset

 is greater than its predecessor 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}$

; the recursive algorithm does not compare to 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{4}$
\end_inset

 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{9}$
\end_inset

 is relatively prime to the earlier polynomials, so irreducibility is not
 a sufficient criterion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are other ways to start the table, and to index the polynomials.
 The given indexing has the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+1$
\end_inset

, taken as binary, encodes the coefficients of the polynomial.
 The order of the polynomial is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lceil \log_{2}\left(2n+1\right)\right\rceil $
\end_inset

.
 The index 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 itself encodes the orbit of the midpoint.
 That is, writing 
\begin_inset Formula $n=b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{p}$
\end_inset

 for binary digits 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}^{k}\left(\beta/2\right)<1/2$
\end_inset

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 always corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2<\beta/2$
\end_inset

 always.
 By convention, the last digit is always 1, also.

Although there are as many of these polynomials as there are Lyndon words,
 there is no obvious way to write a bijection between the two.
 It is almost possible to do so by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $2n$
\end_inset

 in binary, and then reversing the order of the bits, left-to-right.
 One almost gets the Lyndon words in the correct order, except 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in the middle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: so, for example, in the table above, one can get the Lyndon order by exchangin
g 10 with 12, and 13 with 14.
 But the table above cannot be re-ordered: the given ordering encodes the
 orbit of the midpoint.
 Apparently, although a given orbit can be cyclically rotated to obtain
 a Lyndon word, the initial segment of the orbit is not a Lyndon word itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Questions that present themselves include: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is there a generating function for the squence of allowed values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

? What is it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How long is the initial segment of each periodic orbit, before the orbit
 attains it's Lyndon word form? What are the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 where the initial orbits are not in Lyndon form?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Golden Roots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems natural to assume that the real roots have some distribution.
 This seems not to be the case.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Distribution-of-Golden"

\end_inset

 shows the numerically computed (bin-counted) distribution of the zeros
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n<2^{k}$
\end_inset

 for three different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests that, in the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $k\to\infty$
\end_inset

, almost all 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 have roots that approach 2.
 Although the roots appear to be dense in 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta<2$
\end_inset

, essentially all of the weight of that density is at 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

.
 Since the roots are countable, the density clearly becomes very thin.

The bin-counted distribution of roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 for three different cutoffs, and the corresponding eyeballed fit.
 Bin-counting proceeds by dividing the range 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta<2$
\end_inset

 into 1303 equal–width bins.
 Proceeding methodically to find roots for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n<2^{k}$
\end_inset

 for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, each root is assigned to a bin.
 At the end of the counting process, the bin-counts are normalized by the
 width of the bin, and the total number of roots observed (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 by the Moreau counting function).
 For fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, the distribution appears to be approximately exponential (but not quite
 - there is a deviation from linearity in the graph above, just barely discernab
le by naked eye).
 Three different 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

's are shown, and three eyeballed fits.
 The general trend appears to be that, for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, the distribution is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\simeq k+3-\log_{2}k\simeq\log_{2}M_{k+3}$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, the 
\begin_inset Formula $k\to\infty$
\end_inset

 limit accumulates all the measure at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

.

This figure visualizes the inverse distance between golden means.
 A total of 
\begin_inset Formula $1375=\sum_{k=1}^{12}M_{k}$
\end_inset

 roots were obtained, and then sorted into ascending order.
 Letting 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 represent the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th root in this sequence, this shows the reciprocal distance 
\begin_inset Formula $1/1375\left(r_{n+1}-r_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Increasing the number of roots essentially just rescales this graph, making
 it progressively more vertical.
 In essence, almost all of the roots accumulate near 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

; roots become increasingly rare the smaller the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 In the limit, one might say that essentially all roots are at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

: although the roots are dense in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta<2$
\end_inset

, the counting measure indicates that they are accumulating at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

 only.

\begin_layout Subsection
Complex Roots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What are the complex roots? Numerical work clearly indicates that they seem
 to be approximately cyclotomic in some sense or another.
 They seem to be more-or-less uniformly distributed in an approximate circle,
 always.
 The modulus of most of the complex roots appear to be less than one.
 This is violated for the complex roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2^{k}}\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{k+2}-\beta^{k+1}-1$
\end_inset

, where some of the roots in the right-hand quadrant have a modulus larger
 than one.
 By contrast, the complex roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2^{k}-1}\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{k+1}-\sum_{j=0}^{k}\beta^{j}$
\end_inset

 seem to always have a modulus less than one.
 These two seem to be the extreme cases: in general, the polynomials appear
 to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approximately cyclotomic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Its not clear how to make this statement more precise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These numerical results can be argued heuristically: just divide the polynomial
 by it's leading order.
 That is, a general polynomial of this form is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}-\sum_{j=0}^{k}b_{j}z^{k-j}
\]

\end_inset

with the convention that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}=b_{k}=1$
\end_inset

, and the bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $n=b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{p}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to a terminating orbit.
 Dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{k+1}$
\end_inset

gives a series 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1-\frac{1}{z}-\frac{b_{1}}{z^{2}}-\frac{b_{2}}{z^{3}}-\cdots
\]

\end_inset

Clearly, this can have a zero only when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<2$
\end_inset

 as otherwise, the terms get too small too quickly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Golden 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci Sequences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is well known that the golden ratio occurs as limit of the ratio of adjacent
 Fibonacci numbers:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varphi=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{F_{m}}{F_{m-1}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}=F_{m-1}+F_{m-2}$
\end_inset

.
 There is a generalization of this, which also has received attention: the
 tribonacci, quadronacci, 
\emph on
etc
\emph default
.
 sequences, whose limits are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha_{n}=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{F_{m}^{(n)}}{F_{m-1}^{(n)}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}^{(n)}=F_{m-1}^{(n)}+F_{m-2}^{(n)}+\cdots+F_{m-n}^{(n)}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it possible that the real roots of the polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(\beta)$
\end_inset

 are also the roots of such sequences? But of course they are! Given a finite
 string of binary digits 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k}$
\end_inset

, write the beta-Fibonacci sequence as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{m}^{\{b\}}=b_{0}F_{m-1}^{\{b\}}+b_{1}F_{m-2}^{\{b\}}+\cdots b_{k}F_{m-k}^{\{b\}}
\]

\end_inset

The name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beta-Fibonacci
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is needed because the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generalized Fibonacci sequence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is already in wide circulation for the special case of all bits being one.
 The ratio of successive terms is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha^{\{b\}}=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{F_{m}^{\{b\}}}{F_{m-1}^{\{b\}}}
\]

\end_inset

and is given as the (positive) real root of the polynomial
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{k+1}-b_{0}\beta^{k}-b_{1}\beta^{k-1}-\cdots-b_{k}=0
\]

\end_inset

These polynomials and their roots were already enumerated and tabulated
 in the previous section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta-Fibonacci sequences do not appear by accident: these sequences
 have an ordinary generating function (OGF) given by the polynomial! That
 is,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}z^{m}F_{m}^{\{b\}}=\frac{z^{k}}{1-b_{0}z-b_{1}z^{2}-\cdots-b_{k}z^{k+1}}=\frac{1}{zp_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

The factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{k}$
\end_inset

 in the numerator serves only to initiate the sequence so that 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{0}^{\{b\}}=\cdots=F_{k-1}^{\{b\}}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{k}^{\{b\}}=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These sequences are generic: they indicate how many different ways one can
 partition the integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 into elements of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{0},2b_{1},3b_{2},\cdots,\left(k+1\right)b_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 So, for example, the entry for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=12$
\end_inset

 in the table below corresponds to OEIS A079971, which describes the number
 of ways an integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 can be partitioned into 1, 2 and 5 (or that 
\begin_inset Formula $5m$
\end_inset

 can be partitioned into nickels, dimes and quarters).
 This corresponds to the bit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =11001$
\end_inset

; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{0},2b_{1},3b_{2},\cdots,\left(k+1\right)b_{k}\right\} =\left\{ 1\cdot1,2\cdot1,3\cdot0,4\cdot0,5\cdot1\right\} =\left\{ 1,2,5\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 From such partitions, it appears that one can build partitions of the positive
 integers that are disjoint, and whose union is the positive integers.
 This suggests a question: can these partititions be expressed as Beatty
 sequences?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous table is partly repeated below, this time annotated with the
 OEIS sequence references.

All of these integer sequences and roots participate in a number of curious
 relations having a regular form; this is, of course, the whole point of
 listing them in the OEIS.
 This suggests a question: do the known relationships generalize to the
 beta-shift setting?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, there are various known relations for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generalized golden means
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These are the roots of the series for which all 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=1$
\end_inset

, that is, the roots of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta^{k+1}-\beta^{k}-\beta^{k-1}-\cdots-1=0
\]

\end_inset

In the present notation, these would be the roots of the polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2^{k}-1$
\end_inset

.
 Such roots can be rapidly computed by a series provided by Hare, Prodinger
 and Shallit
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hare14"
literal "true"

\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{\alpha_{k}}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{j}{j\left(k+1\right) \choose j-1}\frac{1}{2^{j\left(k+1\right)}}
\]

\end_inset

This series is obtained by making good use of the Lagrange inversion formula.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th generalized golden mean, i.e.
 the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2^{k}-1}\left(\alpha_{k}\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Can the Hare series be extended to provide the roots 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$

-Fibonacci sequences as shifts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nature of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci sequences as shift sequences can be emphasized by noting that
 they arise from the iteration of a 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(k+1\right)\times\left(k+1\right)$
\end_inset

 matrix in lower-Hessenberg form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
B=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
b_{0} & 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
b_{1} & 0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
b_{2} & 0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots &  & \ddots & \vdots\\
b_{k-1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1\\
b_{k} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0
\end{array}\right]\label{eq:golden matrix}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th element of the sequence is obtained from the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th iterate 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{m}$
\end_inset

.
 That such iteration results in integer sequences has long been observed
 in the theory of continued fractions.
 It's useful to work an explicit example.
 For the golden ratio, one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

and the iterates are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B^{2}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 & 1\\
1 & 1
\end{array}\right],\;B^{3}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
3 & 2\\
2 & 1
\end{array}\right],\;B^{4}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
5 & 3\\
3 & 2
\end{array}\right],\;B^{n}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
F_{n} & F_{n-1}\\
F_{n-1} & F_{n-2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{n}$
\end_inset

 being the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th Fibonacci number, as usual.
 For the general case, one has that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B^{m}=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
F_{m}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-1}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-2}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & \cdots & F_{m-k+1}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-k}^{\left\{ b\right\} }\\
F_{m-1}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-2}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-3}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & \cdots & F_{m-k}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-k-1}^{\left\{ b\right\} }\\
F_{m-2}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-3}^{\left\{ b\right\} } &  & \cdots\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
F_{m-k+1}^{\left\{ b\right\} } &  &  & \cdots\\
F_{m-k}^{\left\{ b\right\} } &  &  & \cdots &  & F_{m-2k}^{\left\{ b\right\} }
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

so that the top row consists of the latest sequence values.
 When multiplied by the bits, this just generates the next iterate in the
 sequence.
 The upper-diagonal 1's just serve to shift columns over by one, with each
 iteration: that is why it's a shift!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristic polynomial of this matrix is, of course, the polynomial
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det\left[B-xI\right]=\left(-1\right)^{k}p_{n}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

Thus, we can trivially conclude that the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 are given by the roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This matrix is in lower-Hessenberg form; this makes it obvious that it's
 a shift; a finite shift, in this case.

Summary

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize: any one of these: the integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

\end_inset

, the integer sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}^{\left\{ b\right\} }$

 and, of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 itself can each be used as a stand-in for the others.
 Specifying one determines the others; they all uniquely map to one-another.
 They are all equivalent labels.
 Fashionably abusing notation, 
\begin_inset Formula $n\equiv p_{n}\left(x\right)\equiv\left\{ b\right\} \equiv F_{m}^{\left\{ b\right\} }\equiv m_{p}\equiv w\left(\beta\right)\equiv\beta\equiv B$

\end{equation}

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $p<k$

 the length of the bit sequence, and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{k}=T_{\beta}^{k+1}\left(\beta/2\right)=\beta p_{n}\left(\beta\right)/2=0$

 terminating, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 is the positive root of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(x\right)$

Four of the correspondences given above ask for periodic orbits.
 Three of these can be extended to non-periodic orbits in an unambiguous
 and uncontroversial way.
 The extensions are covered in the next two sections.
 The fourth is the numbering 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of the finite orbits.
 These are countable; there is no way to extend the counting number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 to the non-periodic orbits.
 Ineed, there ae too many: the non-periodic orbits are uncountable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Infinite-nacci integer sequences 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta-Fibonacci integer sequence can be extended to arbitrary (
\emph on
viz.

\emph default
 infinite) length bit sequences, as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{m}^{\{b\}}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_{j-1}F_{m-j}^{\{b\}}
\]

\end_inset

starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{0}^{\left\{ b\right\} }=1$
\end_inset

.
 The sum is always finite, but one cannot perform it without first knowing
 at least the first 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 bits of the (now infinite) bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The integer sequence still has the desirable property it had before: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{F_{m}^{\{b\}}}{F_{m-1}^{\{b\}}}
\]

\end_inset

Here, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 value is the one associated to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 So, as before, the real number 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and the bit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

 label exactly the same orbit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remarkably, one can be sloppy in how one deals with periodic orbits with
 this extention.
 One has two choices that are equivalent: One choice is to truncate, so
 that the bit-sequence ends with all-zeros, effectively rendering it of
 finite length.
 The alternative is to allow it to continue periodically, forever.
 Either form results in the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci sequence! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example, consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.6$
\end_inset

, which is close to the golden ratio, but not quite.
 It has an infinite non-periodic (non-recurring) bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =101010010100101000000100\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 The generated integer sequence is 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}^{\{b\}}=1,1,1,2,3,5,8,12,20,32,51,82,130,209,335,535,\cdots$
\end_inset

 which undershoots the Fibonacci sequence (12 appears, where we expected
 13, and 20 instead of 21, and so on).
 The ratio of the last two is 
\begin_inset Formula $535/335=1.597\cdots$
\end_inset

 and the previous is 
\begin_inset Formula $335/209=1.603\cdots$
\end_inset

 and the ratio of successive elements eventually converges to 1.6.
 By comparison, the Fibonacci sequence is generated by the bit-string 1010101010...
 of alternating ones and zeros.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci representation of the orbits has the remarkable property that
 one does not need some 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 mechanism to know if some orbit is periodic or not.
 This dual-representation of periodic orbits is reminiscent of a property
 commonly seen in Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 representations of the real number line, where the dyadic rationals (which
 are countable, of course) map to two distinct bit-sequences (one ending
 in all-ones, the other ending in all-zeros).
 A more general setting for this is given in symbolic dynamics, where the
 totally disconnected Bernoulli scheme 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 can be used to represent elements of certain countable sets two different
 ways.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N=10$
\end_inset

, one famously has that 1.000...=0.999...
 as an example.
 So likewise here, one can toggle between finite and infinite-periodic strings.
 So, given a finite string 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k-1},b_{k}$
\end_inset

 which has, by definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=1$
\end_inset

, create a new finite string that is twice as long: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b^{\prime}\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k-1},0,b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k}$
\end_inset

 which necessarily has exactly the same beta-Fiboanacci sequence.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}^{\{b^{\prime}\}}=F_{m}^{\{b\}}$
\end_inset

.
 Once can repeat this process 
\emph on
ad infinitum
\emph default
, obtaining an infinite periodic string.
 The difference between these two is simply the difference between a less-than-s
ign, and a less-than-or-equal sign used in the generation of the orbit,
 as noted at the very begining of this chapter.
 We have proven: finite orbits are exactly the same as infinite periodic
 orbits, at least when represented by real numbers and by integer sequences.
 Conversely, the difference between using 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\le$
\end_inset

 during iteration is immaterial for describing convergents.

\begin_layout Subsection

-Polynomials
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An infinite polynomial is, of course, an analytic function.
 The goal here is to extend the finite framework.
 The definition of the polynomials above requires a finite bit sequence.
 This can be extended to an asymptotic series, by writing first
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}\left(1-b_{0}z^{-1}-b_{1}z^{-2}-\cdots-b_{k}z^{-k-1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Set 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=1/z$
\end_inset

 to get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\zeta^{k+1}p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)=1-b_{0}\zeta-b_{1}\zeta^{2}-\cdots-b_{k}\zeta^{k+1}
\]

\end_inset

which extends to the holomorphic function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)=1-\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}b_{j}\zeta^{j+1}
\]

\end_inset

This is manifestly holomorphic on the unit disk, as each coefficient is
 either zero or one.
 It has a positive real zero, of course: 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(1/\beta\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Comparing to eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:holomorphic-disk"

\end_inset

, we see that this is exactly the same function, or rather, it's negative.
 Indeed, following the definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}=d_{n}\left(1/2\right)$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $D\left(\beta;\zeta\right)=-q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)$

 Of course, one could just declare the matrix elements of the operator to
 be this-and-such, but these matrix elements are with respect to what basis?
 Is the operator even bounded? The answer to the second question is obviously

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristic equation of

\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\beta>1$
\end_inset

 is too large, although the 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1=\left\lfloor \log_{2}n\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 other roots are conveniently arranged near the unit circle, more-or-less
 equidistant from one another.
 The solution is to rescale 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

.
 The Frobenius-Perron eigenvalue is now one, and the remaining eigenvalues
 distributed near or on a circle of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

.
 We may as well take the transpose as well, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}=B^{T}/\beta$
\end_inset

 is in upper-Hessenberg form.
 Rescaled in this way, it now seems safe to declare, by fiat, that the operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is the correct extension of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 to infinite dimensions.
 Just to be explicit: given the bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 has the matrix elements
\begin_inset Formula

\left\langle j+1\left|\mathcal{B}_{\beta}\right|j\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{\beta}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with all other entries being zero.
 This is clearly in upper-Hessenberg form, with the subdiagonal providing
 the shift.

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}$

 This is obviously so: the subdiagonal entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}$

 act as a shift on 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and the top row is just
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}v=\lambda v$
\end_inset

, with vector elements 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

, then the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v\left(x\right)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}d_{j}\left(x\right)v_{j}
\]

\end_inset

 is an eigenfunction of the transfoer operator: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}v\right]\left(x\right)=\lambda v\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, or, explicitly:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\beta}\left[v\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)+v\left(\frac{x}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-x\right)=\lambda v\left(x\right)\label{eq:fundamental-shift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is just eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:xfer oper"

\end_inset

.
 So, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, this is just 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\sigma$
\end_inset

 which is just eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:coherent-first-order"

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

, the invariant measure, as always.
 But it also says more: the 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 solutions to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}v=\lambda v$
\end_inset

 are necessarily of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\left(1,\left(\lambda\beta\right)^{-1},\left(\lambda\beta\right)^{-2},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

, because the subdiagonal forces this shift.
 To satisfy the the top row of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

, one must have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\left\langle 0\left|\mathcal{B}_{\beta}\right|j\right\rangle v_{j}=\frac{1}{\beta}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{b_{j}}{\left(\lambda\beta\right)^{j}}=\lambda\left(1-q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\frac{1}{\lambda\beta}\right)\right)=\lambda
\]

\end_inset

and so the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is exactly the eigenvalue that solves the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-series 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(1/\lambda\beta\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This falls short of being a full proof; this line of argumentation only
 affirms the ansatz 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:coherent-first-order"

\end_inset

.
 To recap: periodic orbits have an associated shift matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

; this extends naturally to a shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 for non-periodic orbits.
 The shift operator has a sufficiently simple form that it's eigenvectors
 can be explicitly written down in closed form; they are necessarily coherent
 states.
 The top row of the shift operator defines a holomorphic function 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }$
\end_inset

 whose zeros correspond to eigenstates of the shift operator.
 The holomorphic function is determined by the binary digit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The binary digit sequence is obtained from the iterated midpoint, as 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}=d_{j}\left(1/2\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}\left(x\right)=1$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $x<T^{n}\left(\beta/2\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This is enough to prove eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:fundamental-shift"

\end_inset

 holds for the special value 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 (for 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

); it is no enough to show that it holds for any 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 For the full proof, one needs the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
The above provides a spur to further examine the spectrum of the transfer
 operator.
 Some examples are worked through here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To recap: eigenstates of the transfer operator correspond with the zeros
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)$
\end_inset

, or, more precisely, the zeros for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right|\le1$
\end_inset

.
 The reason for this limitation is that the eigenstates are explictly given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v\left(x\right)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}d_{m}\left(x\right)\zeta^{m}
\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=1/\beta\lambda$
\end_inset

; this is absolutely convergent only for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right|<1$
\end_inset

.
 One might hope to analytically extend this to the entire complex plane,
 but the extension depends on the digit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{m}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We're lacking in a tractable mechanism to perform this extension.

 the golden ratio.
 The corresponding finite beta-polynomial is 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ 11\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)=1-\zeta-\zeta^{2}$

which has a positive real zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=1/\varphi$
\end_inset

 and poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=\pm1$

 The zero corresponds to the FP eigenvalue of one.
 The invariant measure is 
\begin_inset Formula

 The corresponding finite beta-polynomial is 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ 101\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)=1-\zeta-\zeta^{3}$

\end_inset

which has a positive real zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=1/\beta=0.6823\cdots$
\end_inset

 and three poles on the unit circle.
 The FP eigenvalue provides 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.4655\cdots$
\end_inset

 The invariant measure is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v\left(x\right)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{d_{m}\left(x\right)}{\beta^{m}}=\begin{cases}
\frac{\beta}{\beta-1} & \mbox{for }0\le x<T\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)\\

There are many equivalent ways to write the invariant measure; the above

 For example, the third entry could be written as

 The finite bitstring is

 The positive real root is

\end_inset

 is close to one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The general case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generalizing from the above, one finds the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a period-
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 orbit, the infinite series is 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\cdots\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)=q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)/\left(1-\zeta^{k}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first label 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)$
\end_inset

 has a complex zero within the disk is 
\begin_inset Formula $n=16$
\end_inset

.
 As a general rule, it seems that complex zeros inside the disk only appear
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\varphi$
\end_inset

 (I beleive; have not carefully checked.
 This seems reasonable, as later chapters show that the region of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\varphi$
\end_inset

 behaves very differently from larger values.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The invariant measure has 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 plateaus.
 The plateau boundaries are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{m}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=\left\{ 0,\cdots,k-1\right\} $
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{0}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{\beta}{2}$
\end_inset

, and so on).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The left-most plateau (of the invariant measure) is at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/\left(\beta-1\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}1/\beta^{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The other plateaus appear to be at simple rational functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, but a precise expression is elusive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve the last issue, perhaps one can find tools in Galois theory.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}\left[\zeta\right]$
\end_inset

 be the ring of polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 and consider the quotient ring 
\begin_inset Formula $L=\mathbb{R}\left[\zeta\right]/q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is a field extension of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 and so one expects a Galois group 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Gal}\left(L/\mathbb{R}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The plateaus of the invariant measure are presumably associated with the
 group elements.
 This seems like a promising direction to go in: perhaps this is just enough
 to explain the length of an orbit, the sequence of points in the orbit,
 the reason that some polynomials are forbidden (they don't generate prime
 ideals), the appareance of Moreau's necklace-counting function,
\emph on
 etc
\emph default
.
 This remains an unfinished exercise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Factorization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The polynomials factorize.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 denote the real positive root of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 – that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(r_{n}\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Then one has the factorizations (dropping the subscript on 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 for readability)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{1}\left(x\right)=x^{2}-x-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x+r-1\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x+p_{0}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}\left(x\right)=x-1$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, there are two order-3 polynomials.
 They factor as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{2}\left(x\right)=x^{3}-x-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{2}+xp_{0}\left(r\right)+rp_{0}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

while
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{3}\left(x\right)=x^{3}-x^{2}-x-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{2}+xp_{0}\left(r\right)+p_{1}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

Continuing in this way, there are three order-4 polynomials.
 They factor as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{7}\left(x\right)=x^{4}-x^{3}-x^{2}-x-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}p_{0}\left(r\right)+xp_{1}\left(r\right)+p_{3}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{6}\left(x\right)=x^{4}-x^{3}-x^{2}-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}p_{0}\left(r\right)+xp_{1}\left(r\right)+rp_{1}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

and (noting that there is no 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{5}$
\end_inset

 that occurs in the series)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{4}\left(x\right)=x^{4}-x^{3}-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}p_{0}\left(r\right)+xrp_{0}\left(r\right)+r^{2}p_{0}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's clearly a progression, but perhaps a bit difficult to grasp.
 It can be more clearly seen by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}=q_{2n+1}$
\end_inset

 and then writing out 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+1$
\end_inset

 in binary.
 So, once again, from the top:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{1}\left(x\right)=q_{11}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x+q_{1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}=q_{1}\left(r\right)$
\end_inset

 which adopts the shorthand that the 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 polynomials on the right-hand side always have 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 as an argument, which can be dropped for clarity.
 Note also that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}\left(r\right)=r$
\end_inset

 was already previously observed, in an earlier section.
 That is, using the dropped-
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 convention, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}=r$
\end_inset

.
 Next
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{2}\left(x\right)=q_{101}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{2}+xq_{1}+q_{01}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, by definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{01}\left(x\right)\equiv rq_{1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Next,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{3}\left(x\right)=q_{111}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{2}+xq_{1}+q_{11}\right)
\]

\end_inset

is the second factorization of order 3.
 For order 4, one has
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{4}\left(x\right)=q_{1001}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}q_{1}+xq_{01}+q_{001}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, this time, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{001}\left(x\right)=xq_{01}\left(x\right)=x^{2}q_{1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Continuing,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{6}\left(x\right)=q_{1101}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}q_{1}+xq_{11}+q_{011}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, by defintion, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{011}\left(x\right)\equiv xq_{11}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Finally,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{7}\left(x\right)=q_{1111}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}q_{1}+xq_{11}+q_{111}\right)
\]

\end_inset

It is worth doing one more, just to clinch that the reversal of the bit
 sequence is indeed correct.
 For this purpose, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{12}=q_{11001}$
\end_inset

 should serve well.
 One has
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p_{12}\left(x\right)=q_{11001}\left(x\right)= & \left(x-r\right)\left(x^{4}+x^{3}p_{0}\left(r\right)+x^{2}p_{1}\left(r\right)+xrp_{1}\left(r\right)+r^{2}p_{1}\left(r\right)\right)\\
= & \left(x-r\right)\left(x^{4}+x^{3}q_{1}+x^{2}q_{11}+xq_{011}+q_{0011}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general pattern should now be clear.
 Given one of the admissible bit sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k-1}b_{k}$
\end_inset

 and recalling that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=1$
\end_inset

 always, (and that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 always) one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(z\right)=q_{b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k-1}b_{k}}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}-b_{0}z^{k}-b_{1}z^{k-1}-\cdots-b_{k-1}z-1
\]

\end_inset

which has the factorization, with bits reversed:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k-1}b_{k}}\left(z\right)=\left(z-r\right)\left(z^{k}+z^{k-1}q_{b_{0}}+z^{k-2}q_{b_{1}b_{0}}+z^{k-3}q_{b_{2}b_{1}b_{0}}+\cdots+q_{b_{k-1}b_{k-2}\cdots b_{1}b_{0}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, as already noted, each 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is a polynomial in the root 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 Although, notationally, the root 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 was taken as the real root, the above factorization works for any root.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trick can be repeated.
 Although at first it might seem daunting, the pattern is uniform: every
 power of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 occurred in the above.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $s\ne r$
\end_inset

 be some other root.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k-1}b_{k}}\left(z\right)=\left(z-r\right)\left(z-s\right)\left(z^{k-1}+\left(s+q_{b_{0}}\right)z^{k-2}+\left(s^{2}+sq_{b_{0}}+q_{b_{o}b_{1}}\right)z^{k-3}+\cdots\right)
\]

\end_inset

The coefficient of the next term being 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{3}+s^{2}q_{b_{0}}+sq_{b_{o}b_{1}}+q_{b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}}$
\end_inset

 and so on.
 From this point one, this becomes just an ordinary factorization of polynomials...
 well, but so was the first step, as well.
 What made the first step interesting was that, because the coefficients
 at that step were explicitly either zero or one, the corresponding reversal
 of the bit sequence became manifest.

\begin_layout Standard
One may as well bring this detour to a close.
 There's nothing particularly magic in the above factorization, other than
 the combinatorial re-arrangement of the polynomial labels.
 A generic polynomial factorization looks like the below, for comparison.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(x\right)=x^{n+1}+c_{0}x^{n}+c_{1}x^{n-1}+\cdots c_{n}
\]

\end_inset

and if 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is a root of 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
viz
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(r\right)=0$
\end_inset

 then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p\left(x\right)= & \left(x-r\right)\left(x^{n}+\left(r+c_{0}\right)x^{n-1}+\left(r^{2}+c_{0}r+c_{1}\right)x^{n-2}+\cdots\right)\\
= & \left(x-r\right)\left(x^{n}+a_{0}x^{n-1}+a_{1}x^{n-2}+\cdots\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{k}=r^{k+1}+\sum_{j=0}^{k}c_{j}r^{k-j}
\]

\end_inset

There are some notable values occurring in the factorization.
 These are shown in the table below:

As may be seen, some of these constants are already notable for various
 reasons.
 Many are also the real roots of yet other polynomials, of a not entirely
 obvious form.
 (Well, the 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 polynomials will always be obvious expansions in binomial coefficients).
 The suggestion here is that these are all in turn part of some filigreed
 partially-ordered set of intertwining polynomials.
 Exactly how to express that intertwining in any sort of elegant or insightful
 way is not obvious.

\begin_layout Section
Bergman (Hessenberg) Polynomials
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a matrix operator in Hessenberg form, it can be interpreted as a right-shi
ft on the space of polynomials.
 Such polynomials form an orthogonal basis for a certain kind of Hilbert
 space, called the Bergman space.
 They are studied in applied mathematics, as they are orthogonal over some
 measure on the complex plane.
 The Hessenberg operator is a generalization of the better-known case of
 the Jacobi operator, which has it's own extensive theory, including spectra
 and scattering, and is important for several exactly solvable non-linear
 models in physics, including the Toda lattice
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Teschl00"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The Hessenberg operator presumably has an equally rich theory, but it does
 not appear to be currently known; the breadth and scope of existing publication
s is limited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general framework for the Hessenberg polynomials is sketched below,
 including a fast and informal definition of Bergman space (the space on
 which the polynomials are orthogonal).
 The Hessenberg matrix is explicitly solvable on the left, and can be explicitly
 brought into a from that exhibits the right-shift operator.
 In the general theory, the change of basis from the shift operator to the
 Hessenberg matrix is known to be the Cholesky decomposition of a moment
 matrix, and specifically, the moments of the measure on which the polynomials
 are orthogonal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two Hessenberg operators in this text: the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 in the wavelet basis, and the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 generated from the midpoint orbits.
 The second is already obviously a shift, and so everything below follows
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trivially
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from it.
 The first form is is numerically and analytically difficult.
 Needless to say, the section below treats the firs rather than the second.
 XXX TODO this should be fixed, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is both simpler and more enlightening overall.
 Later ...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Working backwards from the beta shift, the first asymptotic term in the
 measure can be extracted.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>\varphi$
\end_inset

, it appears to be a Dirac delta (point mass) located at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

 on the complex plane, with a blancmange-like fractal curve giving the weight.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\varphi$
\end_inset

, it appears to be the derivative of the Dirac delta, with a different blancmang
e-like fractal curve giving the weight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bergman Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a matrix operator in Hessenberg form, it can be interpreted as a right-shi
ft on the space of polynomials.
 That is, given an unreduced Hessenberg matrix with matrix entries 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

, one can write a recurrence relation that defines a sequence of polynomials
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
zp_{n}\left(z\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}A_{kn}p_{k}\left(z\right)\label{eq:Hessenberg polynomials}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}\left(z\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 This relation is easily solvable in closed form, as the recurrence relation
 terminates in a finite number of steps.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important property of these polynomials is that the zeros of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 correspond to the eigenvalues of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 principle submatrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Numeric exploration of these polynomials confirms the previous results
 on eigenvalues obtained from direct diagonalization: the zeros of the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 seems to lie mostly near the circle of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

, distributed uniformly over all angles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If all of the sub-diagonal entries obey 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{n+1,n}>0$
\end_inset

, then the polynomials form an orthonormal basis for Bergman space.
 That is, there exists a domain in the complex plane on which the polynomials
 provide a basis for a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions on that domain
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Saff12,Tomeo11,Escri11"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 That is, one has the orthogonality relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta_{mn}=\int_{D}p_{m}\left(\overline{z}\right)p_{n}\left(z\right)d\mu\left(z\right)
\]

\end_inset

for some domain 
\begin_inset Formula $D\subset\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 of the complex plane, and some (Borel) measure 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mu$
\end_inset

 on that domain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as an operator with a continuous spectrum.
 To do this, fix a certain, specific value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=c$
\end_inset

 a constant, and then notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}=\left(p_{n}\left(z\right)\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$
\end_inset

 is a vector having the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}\vec{p}=z\vec{p}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}$
\end_inset

 is a left-eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

; equivalently, a right-eigenvector of its transpose 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, the spectrum is continuous on the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrix operator 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can also be interpreted as a right-shift on Bergman space.
 To do this, define
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{A}\left(w,z\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}p_{k}\left(w\right)A_{kn}p_{n}\left(\overline{z}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Then, given some holomorphic function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 decomposed in terms of the polynomials, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)=\sum_{n}a_{n}p_{n}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

, one has that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left[\mathcal{A}f\right]\left(w\right)= & \int\mathcal{A}\left(w,z\right)f\left(z\right)d\mu\left(z\right)\\
= & \sum_{k}\sum_{n}p_{k}\left(w\right)A_{kn}a_{n}\\
= & w\sum_{n}a_{n}p_{n}\left(w\right)\\
= & wf\left(w\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

That is, given a sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

, the Hessenberg matrix acts as a right-shift, mapping it to the sequence
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,a_{0},a_{1},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is perhaps a bit silly, as one could instead just perform the same
 manipulation without the 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

, by observing that, formally,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{A}\left(w,z\right)=w\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}p_{k}\left(w\right)p_{n}\left(\overline{z}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above treatment is breezy and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

formal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, paying no heed to summability, convergence or responding to any questions
 about what spaces the various vectors may live in.
 This is as appropriate, since the task here is to discover which spaces
 are the appropriate ones, when the Hessenberg matrix arises from the beta
 shift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a bit mis-used, here, as a vague synonym for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinite-dimensional matrix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Properly, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be reserved for an infinite-dimensional matrix acting on some given
 space, having general properties that are independent of the basis chosen
 for that space.
 So far, that might not be the case here: the infinite-dimensional matrices
 here might not be bounded operators; they might not even be continuous,
 viz.
 we have not ruled out the possibility that the space of interest is some
 Fréchet space or some more general topological vector space.
 It is well known that operators on such spaces can have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unexpected
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 discontinuities, unexpected in that they are not seen in ordinary Banach
 spaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, if polynomials obtained from the beta shift are orthogonal
 on some domain 
\begin_inset Formula $D\subset\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 that is the support of some measure 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mu$
\end_inset

, it is not at all clear what this measure might be.
 They are certainly not orthogonal on the unit disk, with uniform measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice also that the above treatment seems to be a special case of a more
 general principle: when an operator has a continuous spectrum, it can sometimes
 be interpreted as a right-shift.
 That is, given some arbitrary operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

, then if one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}f=\lambda f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 takes arbitrary values 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in D\subset\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 can be taken to be a right-shift operator, provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $f=f\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 can be decomposed into a set of orthogonal polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.

 Toeplitz.
 That is, if the diagonals of

 have nice limits, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty}A_{n-k,n}$

 For the square-integrable norm, this basis is the basis of a Hilbert space,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet, something funny happens on the unit disk.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{m}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 be the polynomials, and for some sequence of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

, consider a generic function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(z\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}p_{k}\left(z\right)
\]

\end_inset

Consider the case where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are a right-eigenvector of the Hessenberg operator, that is, where 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}A_{km}a_{m}=\lambda a_{k}
\]

\end_inset

Substituting into the above, one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(z\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}A_{km}a_{m}p_{k}\left(z\right)=\frac{z}{\lambda}\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}a_{m}p_{m}\left(z\right)=\frac{zf\left(z\right)}{\lambda}
\]

\end_inset

There are two alternatives to solving this; either 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Since this is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, then if 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\lambda$
\end_inset

 is part of the domain of the Bergman space, then one must conclude that
 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)=0$
\end_inset

 everywhere.
 That is, right-eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 correspond to functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 To invent a new name, by analogy to the Fredholm alternative, perhaps this

Suppose one is given an (arbitrary) sequence of polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p_{n}\left(z\right)\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$
\end_inset

, such that the order of

\end_inset

 Then each individual polynomial can be expanded as or

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(z\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}p_{nk}z^{k}

This defines an infinite matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}=\left[p_{nk}\right]$
\end_inset

, provided that the coefficients are extended so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nk}=0$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $k>n$
\end_inset

.
 This matrix is manifestly lower-triangular.
 Writing vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{z}=\left(z^{n}\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}=\left(p_{n}\left(z\right)\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now the case where the polynomials were constructed from some irreducib

\begin_inset Formula $A$

 The earlier observation that 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}$
\end_inset

 is a shift, namely, that 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}\vec{p}=z\vec{p}$
\end_inset

 can now be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A^{T}\mathcal{P}\vec{z}=z\mathcal{P}\vec{z}=\mathcal{P}z\vec{z}=\mathcal{PK}\vec{z}
\]

\end_inset

In the above, the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 without the vector notation is just a scalar, and thus commutes (trivially)
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

.
 Its eliminated by explicitly making use of the right-shift (Koopman) operator,
 which, in this basis, is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{K}=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ddots\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ddots
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 is lower-triangular, it is invertible on the right, that is, the inverse
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 exists, and so one is left with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{P}^{-1}A^{T}\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{K}
\]

\end_inset

The irreducibility of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is important, here; non-zero entries on the sub-diagonal are required,
 else trouble ensues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rearranging, this provides an explicit decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 into triangular matrices:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A^{T}=\mathcal{PKP}^{-1}

\end_inset

Taking the transpose, this gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\left[\mathcal{P}^{-1}\right]^{T}\mathcal{K}^{T}\mathcal{P}^{T}
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}^{T}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{P}^{-1}\right]^{T}$
\end_inset

 both being upper-triangular, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}^{T}$
\end_inset

 being the left-shift.
\end_layout

 Given some matrix

\begin_inset Formula $p_{00}=1$
\end_inset

.
 To handle the 
\begin_inset Formula $j=0$
\end_inset

 case in the above, set 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n,-1}=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 is lower triangular, its inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}^{-1}\equiv\mathcal{R}=\left[r_{kn}\right]$
\end_inset

 can be obtained explicitly.
 Along the diagonal, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{nn}=1/p_{nn}$
\end_inset

 while the lower triangular form means 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{kn}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k<n$
\end_inset

.
 For the remaining entries 
\begin_inset Formula $m<n$
\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0=\sum_{k=m}^{n}p_{nk}r_{km}
\]

\end_inset

This can be solved in a finite number of iterations on 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{nn}r_{nm}=-\sum_{k=m}^{n-1}p_{nk}r_{km}

 This is appropriate at this stage: it is the algebraic manipulations that

 One can invent several kinds of norms that might be applicable, but there
 is no particular reason to believe that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}$
\end_inset

 might have a finite norm.
 Likewise, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 may not have a finite norm.
 For the case of the Hessenberg operator originating with the beta shift
 operator, it does not; the individual matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nm}$
\end_inset

 increase without bound.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 is an infinite matrix, but it is not clear that it is also an operator.
 If it is, it is certainly not a compact operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the poor behavior can be brought under control by factoring 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{DN}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}$
\end_inset

 being unitriangular (all ones on the diagonal) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

 a diagonal matrix, with entries 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{D}\right]_{nk}=p_{nn}\delta_{nk}$
\end_inset

.
 With this factorization, one may then write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{N}^{-1}A^{T}\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{DKD}^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{DKD}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 has off-diagonal matrix entries 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{DKD}^{-1}\right]_{nk}=\delta_{n+1,k}p_{nn}/p_{kk}$
\end_inset

.
 This is a rescaling of the shift 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{K}\right]_{nk}=\delta_{n+1,k}$
\end_inset

.
 The scaling factor is exactly the sub-diagonal of the Hessenberg.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nn}/p_{n+1,n+1}=A_{n+1,n}$
\end_inset

 The polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}\vec{z}$
\end_inset

One such result is that when

\begin_inset Formula

The matrix mechanics developed in the previous sections can be used to perform
 asymptotic expansions that rapidly converge to decaying eigenfunctions.

 TODO Write these down.
 TODO flesh out.
 Basically, write a vector

\end_inset

 with elements 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{n}=\omega^{n}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\left|\omega\right|$
\end_inset

 so that this is divergent.
 Then write the formal vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{a}=\left[\mathcal{P}^{T}\right]^{-1}\vec{w}$
\end_inset

 which is formally divergent, but can be truncated in finite dimensions,
 and renormalized to be of unit length.
 Doing so provides an eigenfunction of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The associated eigenvalue is 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\varphi$

Moment Matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Hessenberg matrix is derived from measures on the complex plane,
 it takes the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{RR}^{T}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}=\mathcal{P}^{-1}$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}$
\end_inset

 is the Cholesky decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 This matrix is manifestly symmetric: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{M}^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Direct observation shows that it is almost positive-definite: one finds
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{ij}>0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

 except for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{00}=0$
\end_inset

.
 This result can be strengthened: when 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\varphi$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{ij}>1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

 except for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{00}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{0n}=\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{n0}=1$
\end_inset

.
 But, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>\varphi$
\end_inset

, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{00}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{01}=\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{10}=\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{11}=1$
\end_inset

, while all the rest obey 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{ij}<1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the standard literature, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is usually obtained from some moment matrix, viz, for the integral

\end_inset

 for some measure 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mu\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Might that be the case here? Taking the time to numerically characterize
 the matrix, one finds that the ratio of successive rows (or columns as
 its symmetric) very quickly approaches a limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty,}\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{nm}/\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{n-1,m}=C\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula

Construction of the polynomial sequences require moments.

 expression given by eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Topological Push-Forward
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transfer operator is most generally and correctly defined as an operator
 acting on the topology of a space, and specifically, as the push-forward
 of the (uniform) measure by the iterated function.
 That is, given any open set belonging to the topology, the transfer operator
 assigns a different open set of the topology: it is a map of sets to sets.
 For iterated maps on the unit interval, it is essentially a map of cylinder
 sets, the open sets of the product topology.
 The shift-XOR experiment shows that the ergodic properties arise from the
 Bernoulli shift, and that all other properties, commonly called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chaotic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, are really the side effect of something else, entirely: the internal structure
 of the transfer operator.
 Fiddling with the carry-bits cannot reveal this structure; instead, they
 just define other, pointlessly goofy iterated functions.
 Point trajectories fail to reveal the internal structure of the transfer
 operator, and at best point in a misleading direction.
 To understand the transfer operator, it must be tackled for what it is:
 one must look at how intervals are mapped to intervals, and what sort of
 symmetries can be discovered in this mapping.
 (I've given one sketch of a proof of the transfer operator as a push-forward
 in this reference:
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 There are must surely be better, more accessible and more formal and mathematic

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The action of the transfer operator on the sets belonging to the topology
 of the reals reveals several distinct kinds of actions.
 The topology on the reals can be generated from a basis consisting of connected
 sets.
 The transfer operator will map some connected sets to other connected sets,
 simply moving them around, shrinking or expanding them.
 In other cases, a connected set will be split into two disjoint parts.
 For maps that are continuous, there must be regions that have fixed-points
 and period-doubling routes to chaos: these correspond to the (countable
 number of)

It seems reasonable to argue that each of these different kinds of moves
 creates a distinct group (or monoid) of transformations: in a certain sense,
 those transforms that do not change th connectivity, nor do any folding,
 are all similar to one-another.
 It should be possible to write down exactly which sets belong to this type,
 and then give explicit transformation properties between them.
 Likewise, those connected sets which are split in two are all similar.
 It seems like there should be a prototype: a generic split, followed by
 some re-arrangement of the two parts.
 How can this classification be written in an insightful, useful way?

 of subshifts so that the above vague sketch can be presented in a fairly
 concrete way.
 Unfortunately, most of the relevant material remains rather arcane and
 abstract, lacking in direct accessibility to casual students.
 I am not currently aware of any adequate yet accessible treatment.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What, exactly, is the point of analytic mathematics, especially in the computati
onal age? Can't one just get a fast computer, iterate on the logistic map,
 and find out everything there is to find? Well, of course, yes, and no:
 these questions can be taken as either silly or as deeply philosophical,
 and it is worth the effort to understand them and address them properly.

First, lets dispose of some obvious mis-perceptions.
 If one carefully scrutinizes figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Undershift-Density-Distribution"

\end_inset

, one will find signs of a slight unevenness in the horizontal bars.
 These are numerical artifacts due to statistical under-sampling: they smooth
 out and fade away with additional sampling of the iterated equations.
 There is a way to obtain this same figure, far more rapidly, and without
 this particular form of numerical noise: one can instead iterate on equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eigen-eqn"

\end_inset

.
 This suggests one philosophical answer: the goal of mathematics is to find
 faster ways of computing things; to discover better algorithms.

A uniting theme between this, and the other text that I have written on
 fractal issues, is that they are all explorations of the structure of the
 Cantor set, the structure of the space of infinite sequences of symbols,
 and the structure of the continuum.
 That is, we know the continuum in two different ways: one way is by means
 of the natural topology on the real number line; the other is the product
 topology on the space of binary strings.
 The former is suggested by the physical universe that we actually live
 in: a continuum with spatial extents.
 The latter is suggested by the notion of time and repetition: the making
 of choices naturally leads to a tree structure; tree structures necessarily
 embed in hyperbolic spaces; the Minkowski space that we live in is hyperbolic,
 and this is why, every day, as time passes on, we get to make new choices
 precisely because the amount of room for possibilities is ever-increasing
 as time flows forward.

What, exactly, do the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exactly solvable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 really mean? So, for example, equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:not de Rham curve"

\end_inset

 involves summation and multiplication, which has this aura of comfortable
 preciseness that an iterated function somehow does not.
 Where does this sensation come from? When performing arbitrary-precision
 numerical computations, it should be clear that neither addition nor multiplica
tion are simple or easy: they both require fairly complex algorithms to
 implement, and have not-insignificant run-times.
 To be more precise: the algorithms are non-trivial because one is using
 a binary digit expansion to provide a model for a real number.
 Different representations of the real numbers potentially offer different
 algorithms and performance profiles.
 One could represent reals by rationals, but then two issues arise.
 One is that the rationals are not evenly distributed across the real number
 line: rationals with small denominators cluster about in a fractal fashion,
 studied deeply in number theory.
 As a result, one promptly gets stuck in a quagmire of trying to understand
 what a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uniform distribution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be.
 Binary expansions are more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obviously
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 uniform.
 A more basic issue is that, if working with rationals, one must somehow
 accomplish the addition or multiplication of two integers.
 To accomplish this, one has to represent the integers as sequences of bits,
 which only takes us back to where we started.
 There is no computational oracle that automatically knows the sum or product
 of integers: it has to be computed.
 The analysis being done in this text is a kind of a game, where not only
 is one algebraic arrangement of symbols is being compared to another, but
 also one computational algorithm is being compared for another.
 Unfortunately, this latter comparison is very nearly opaque and hidden.
 If only it could be made visible in some simple fashion.

The situation here is more easily illustrated in a different domain.
 The hyper-geometric series was presented and studied by Gauss; then Kummer,
 Pfaff and Euler observed various identities yoking together different series.
 By the 1950's, thousands of relations were known, along with some algorithms
 that can enumerate infinite series of relations.
 The curious situation is that there is no known algorithm that can enumerate
 all such relations; there is no systematic way to classify them.
 The situation does seem to make clear that there is an interplay between
 infinite series and algorithmic relationships between them.
 Stated a different way: hyper-geometric series are self-similar, and the
 identities relating them are expressions of that self-similarity.

To further sharpen this idea: the dyadic monoid is the generator of self-symmetr
y in many common fractals; this is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

well-known
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and I have explored this in other texts.
 A more general setting for fractal self-similarities is given by tilings
 of the hyperbolic surface: to each tiling, there are corresponding fractals,
 the self-similarity of which are given by the tiling.
 The figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Undershift-Bifurcation-Diagram"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Tent-Map-Bifur"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Logistic-Map-Bifurcation"

\end_inset

 are clearly self-similar in some obscure way: it is visually clear, but
 providing a simple algebraic expression describing the similarity is difficult;
 I have not been successful in this.
 None-the-less, it seems self-evident that it will be the dyadic monoid
 that is somehow responsible for the symmetries, underlying them (unless,
 of course, there is some other, as yet undiscovered structure).

The meta-question is: what is the correct framework by which one can best
 understand the interplay between symmetries, infinite series and algorithms?
 The current tool-set seems impoverished: it does not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

solve
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the systems in this text.
 Worse, current mathematical practice reifies addition and multiplication
 into oracular operations that magically obtain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the right answer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, when it is clear from numerical methods that addition and multiplication
 are necessarily algorithmic operations performed on finite truncations
 of infinite series.
 It would be nice to place these operations on equal footings, so as to
 expose the true nature of this beast.
