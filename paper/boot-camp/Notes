"Cognitive linguistics tells Stefan Gries what a morpheme, a word, a
phrase or a pattern is. 
...
"Corpus linguists [such as Bill Louw] still don't know what a morpheme, 
a word, a phrase or a pattern is. That is why they always insist on 
discussing collocation.

"New evidence, new priorities, new attitudes" in Sinclair, J. (ed)
(2004) How to use corpora in language teaching, Amsterdam: John
Benjamins. His hypothesis #1: THE LEXICAL ITEM IS BEST DESCRIBED
MAXIMALLY, NOT MINIMALLY sum's up for me a lot of what is at the centre
of Bill Louw's concern.

everything is math

Me3:

a cognitive architecture, and "meaning" is nothing more than
"the output of one stage, as input to the next"


http://mailman.uib.no/public/corpora/2008-August/007134.html
Meaning is a negotiated/shared currency between communicators

response to Wolfgang Teubert:
qualia, sensations, iner meanings, discovery of meaning by
data mining and etc.

Teubert replies:
http://mailman.uib.no/public/corpora/2008-August/007161.html
meaing is only in discourse

Me5:
http://mailman.uib.no/public/corpora/2008-August/007166.html
embodied computers using shared, negotiated meaning.

Wilks responds: its in his book -- Electric words -- which does
give many defn's for "meaning".

CL needs controversy

define CL, blast at some of the conservativism

mentions me

=======
Me: thoughts: many theories of meaning. Many algos, eg Terry Winograds
Micro Planner (1972) or SHRDLU blocks-world. But the hard part 
is to get a computer to automatically learn meaing, rather than have 
it engineered in.

I like wolfgang ... 

Synthesize all the different theories of meaning: they are all true to
some extent.

err, except I'm "F" -- connectionist -- page 23 of Electric Words

inductive logic programming

=========

The core premise of my position is that we are well on the road to 
building life-like listening, talking automata -- chatbots that will
have significant command over language, grammar, concepts, ideas, and
modes of expression.  In this light, questions of meaning become not
just philosphical in nature, but have practical impact on the
engineering of such systems.  How is "meaning" best encoded in bits
and bytes, how can it be extracted from text, manipulated, and
re-expressed?

=========
TODO:
read:
* Electric Words: dictionaries, computers and meanings (MIT Press, 1996)
  by Guthrie, Slator and Yorick Willis.
  (philosophy of lang)
* John Sinclair's 'Corpus, Concordance, Collocation' (OUP, 1991) must
  remain your first port of call.
* Gries & Stefanowitsch's collostructional stuff 
* Gries papers on polysemy and near synonymy 
* only some fifty (non-synonymous) semantic primitives from which all
  other concepts are built (Wierzbicka)
* Patrick Hanks as he is both a corpus linguist and a lexicographer.
