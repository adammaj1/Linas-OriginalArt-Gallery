"Cognitive linguistics tells Stefan Gries what a morpheme, a word, a
phrase or a pattern is. 
...
"Corpus linguists [such as Bill Louw] still don't know what a morpheme, 
a word, a phrase or a pattern is. That is why they always insist on 
discussing collocation.

"New evidence, new priorities, new attitudes" in Sinclair, J. (ed)
(2004) How to use corpora in language teaching, Amsterdam: John
Benjamins. His hypothesis #1: THE LEXICAL ITEM IS BEST DESCRIBED
MAXIMALLY, NOT MINIMALLY sum's up for me a lot of what is at the centre
of Bill Louw's concern.

ad-hoc integration of different techniques.

Gries:

Me2:
http://mailman.uib.no/public/corpora/2008-August/007112.html
everything is math

Me3:
http://mailman.uib.no/public/corpora/2008-August/007128.html
a cognitive architecture, and "meaning" is nothing more than
"the output of one stage, as input to the next"


http://mailman.uib.no/public/corpora/2008-August/007134.html
Meaning is a negotiated/shared currency between communicators

Me4:
http://mailman.uib.no/public/corpora/2008-August/007155.html
qualia, sensations, iner meanings, discovery of meaning by
data mining and etc.


=========
TODO:
read:
* John Sinclair's 'Corpus, Concordance, Collocation' (OUP, 1991) must
  remain your first port of call.
* Gries & Stefanowitsch's collostructional stuff 
* Gries papers on polysemy and near synonymy 
* only some fifty (non-synonymous) semantic primitives from which all
  other concepts are built (Wierzbicka)
* Patrick Hanks as he is both a corpus linguist and a lexicographer.
