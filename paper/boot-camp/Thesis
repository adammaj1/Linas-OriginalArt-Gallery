A combination of increasing compute power and commercial utility will
attract new attention to the field of computational linguistics. The
former allows large data-driven experiments to be performed using large
collections of linguistic data, while the latter introduces a pragmatic
engineering ethos where workable methods and practical results are more 
important than theoretucal debates.  The corpus provides the foundation
on which this new trend is built.

Half a century of computational linguistics has revealed that
building AI/NLP systems by hand is a difficult and seemingly 
insurmountable task. However, the task of hand-building seems understood
well-enough that parts of it can be automated -- that is, grammars can
be learned by machine-learning systems, and semantic content can be 
automatically discerned.  The availability of a large corpus appears to
be crucial for this task.
