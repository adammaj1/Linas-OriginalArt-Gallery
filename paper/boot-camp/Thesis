A combination of increasing compute power and commercial utility will
attract new attention to the field of corpus linguistics, and lead an
invasion of computational linguistics principles. Acess to compute
resources allows large data-driven experiments to be performed using large
collections of linguistic data, while commercial utility introduces a 
pragmatic engineering ethos where workable methods and practical results 
are more important than theoretical debates.  The corpus provides the 
fertile ground on which this can take place.

Half a century of computational linguistics has revealed that
building AI/NLP systems by hand is a difficult and seemingly 
insurmountable task. However, the process of hand-building seems understood
well enough that parts of it can be automated -- that is, grammars can
be learned by machine-learning systems, and semantic content can be 
automatically discerned.  The availability of a large corpus appears to
be crucial for this task.  In this sense, the distinction of corpus
linguistics and computational linguistics is blurred[1,2].  

The use of experimental techniques to discover new linguistic facts 
hidden in large corpora have provided many new discoveries. However,
some[3] suggest that there are even stronger ways to discover linguistic
and semantic structure: "linguistics by embodiment".  For humans, it is
easier to learn something by doing it, as opposed to just reading about
it.  Similarly, the embodiment hypothesis is that a software agent can
more easily learn semantic communication by having a virtual, 3D body
allowing linguistic behaviours to be correlated with visual and motor 
senses. This raises important theoretical and philosophical questions 
about "concepts" and "meaning": Is meaning confined to the evidence
attainable from a corpus, or is there a sublime aspect of meaning that
is accessible only by doing, feeling, sensing? In humans, internal
feelings and sensations are not directly accessible to outside observers,
and so such debates can be rendered moot by lack of evidence. The conceit
of corpus linguistics, that meaning is negotiated between speakers[4,5], and
is located only in the discourse[6], has reigned unchallenged.  But what
happens when one has access to a robotic linguistic actor, whose
internal states can be probed and examined? This possiblity even turns corpus
linguistics on its head: does it make sense to collect and analyze a 
corpus of humans talking to automated bankers and pizza ordering
systems?[7] Surely, the fact that the software programming for the pizza
ordering system is available seems to obviate the need to sample its
utterances. And yet, a sampling of the confusions and digressions that
occur during chat between humans and robotic systems can be commericially
valuable: the efficiency and accuracy of these systems can be improved
by studying how communications breaks down.
