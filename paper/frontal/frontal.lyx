\begin_layout Abstract
Questionable ansatz regarding the Berry-Keating variant of the Hilbert-Polya
 conjecture.
 The Berry-Keating conjecture sstates that the zeros of the Riemann zeta
 result from some unknown quantization of 
\begin_inset Formula $(1/2-ixd/dx)$
\end_inset

.
 Then Ansatz here is that the correct operator is similar, via the Minkowski
 Question mark as the similarity transform.
 Viz.
 it is 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{-1}\circ(1/2-ixd/dx)\circ?$
\end_inset

.
 The below are a random collection of notes on this operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the operator 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=\frac{1}{2}-ix\frac{d}{dx}
\]

\end_inset

Lets call this the Berry-Keating operator.
 We are looking for solutions 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H\psi=\omega\psi
\]

\end_inset

First, consider the spectrum of smooth solutions, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 a polynomial or even Laurant series: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi(x)=\sum_{n}a_{n}x^{n}
\]

\end_inset

Plugging in, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega a_{n}=a_{n}/2-ina_{n}$
\end_inset

 which is solved by 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}=const$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{m}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ne k$
\end_inset

: i.e.
 the monomial 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{k}$
\end_inset

 is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=1/2-ik$
\end_inset

.
 This is shallow but suggestive: eigenvalues line up as expected, at least
 for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 For non-integer 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, anyting goes.
 Berry-Keating suggest that some boundary condition on 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 imposes the result that the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

's are the zeroes of the Riemann zeta.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ansatz is as follows: consider the operator 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q=?^{-1}H?
\]

\end_inset

or equivalently the equation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}-ix\frac{d}{dx}\right)?(f(x))=\lambda?(f(x))
\]

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset

 is the Minkowski Question Mark function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a differential equation, this is identical to the previous one, since
 we can take 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(x)=?(f(x))$
\end_inset

.
 The difference here is that, by writing it this way, we are forced to explicitl
y consider non-smooth eigenfunctions; eigenfunctions that might be differentialb
le-nowhere.
 This seems silly on two accounts: first, its in the form of a differential
 equation, so how can we define it to act on non-differentiable functions?
 Secondly, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

derivative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset

 vanishes on all rationals, and is infinite on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

most
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 reals, and seemingly undefined on the rest, at least, measure-theoritically.
 From this point of view, the undertaking seems absurd.
 We continue undaunted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Re-writing the eigenvalue equation as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-ix\frac{d}{dx}?(f(x))=\left(\lambda-\frac{1}{2}\right)?(f(x))
\]

\end_inset

impresses on one an immediate problem: what is the analytic extension of
 ? to the uppr half-plane? It seems that such an extension should exist,
 given how the question mark almost behaves like a modular form.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Some identities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some pertinent factoids from earlier work that are useful to keep in mind.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many self-similarity results, of the form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
?\left(\frac{x}{x+1}\right)=\frac{1}{2}?(x)
\]

\end_inset

which can be extended to general Mobius transforms 
\begin_inset Formula $(ax+b)/(cx+d)$
\end_inset

 in SL(2,Z), albeit having a more complicated expression.
 Viz:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
?\left(\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\right)=\frac{M}{2^{N}}+\left(-1\right)^{Q}\frac{?(x)}{2^{K}}
\]

\end_inset

for integers M,N,Q,K derived in previous papers (state which).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expression 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

can be given a precise meaning (reference: mink-exact.pdf), where, roughly
 speaking, 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is the first derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset

.
 Specifically, it can be intrpreted as a measure, obeying the standard axioms
 of measure theory, and having the values: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{a}^{b}?^{\prime}(x)dx=?(b)-?(a)
\]

\end_inset

which obeys self-symmetry relations as well:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{\left(1+x\right)^{2}}?^{\prime}\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)=\frac{1}{2}?^{\prime}(x)
\]

\end_inset

and more generally
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{\left(cx+d\right)^{2}}?^{\prime}\left(\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\right)=\frac{?^{\prime}(x)}{2^{K}}
\]

\end_inset

for the same K as above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the above identities are most easily obtained by considering continued
 fractions, as in [ref chap-minkowski.pdf], and the others by considering
 the shift operaor on a 1D lattice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there's this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
?^{\prime}\left(y\right)=\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{A^{\prime}\circ A_{k}\left(y\right)}{2}
\]

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A\left(y\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{y}{1-y} & \mbox{ for }0\le y\le\frac{1}{2}\\
\frac{2y-1}{y} & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le y\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

and the iterated function 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{k}$
\end_inset

 is defined so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{k+1}\left(y\right)=A_{k}\circ A\left(y\right)
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}\left(y\right)=y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}\left(y\right)=A\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{k}(y)$
\end_inset

 are piece-wise smooth, and have a differentiable extension 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{A}_{k}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{k}(y)=\left\lfloor \widetilde{A}_{k}(y)\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 i.e.
 such that they are the fractional part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Analytic extension
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some atttempts at an analytic extension of the ? to the upper-half plane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets try this.
 Let
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\sum_{n}a_{n}2^{-n}\quad\mbox{and}\quad y=\sum_{n}b_{n}2^{-n}
\]

\end_inset

be the binary expansions for two real numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 Consider then an extension to the complex plane 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}\to a_{n}(u)$
\end_inset

 and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}\to b_{n}(w)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $u,w$
\end_inset

 complex, and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}(0)=a_{n}$
\end_inset

 and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}(0)=b_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $x\to X(u)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y\to Y(w)$
\end_inset

 become complex-analytic functions with some non-zero radius of convergence.
 The upper-cse is used to distinguish the function from its value at zero.
 We are fishing for a consistent expansion, in that, for some point 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 in the (upper-half) complex plane, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X(z-x)=Y(z-y)
\]

\end_inset

for some finte radius of convergence around 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 At a minimum, we hope for convergence for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<\Im z$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the region of convergence extens to the real line, and better yet, for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|\le\left|x-y\right|$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the region of convergence extends to encompase both 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 Can this be done? Lets try.
 Write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X(u)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2^{-n}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{nk}u^{k}
\]

\end_inset

 and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(w)$
\end_inset

.
 Then, expanding, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X(z-x)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}z^{m}\sum_{k=m}^{\infty}\left({k\atop m}\right)\left(-x\right)^{k-m}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{nk}2^{-n}
\]

\end_inset

and consistency requires that this match, 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-term by 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-term, with the analogous expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(z-y)$
\end_inset

.
 We being by noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n0}=a_{n}$
\end_inset

 is fixed.
 For convenience, let 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{k}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{nk}2^{-n}
\]

\end_inset

for now; we need to solve the equations
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k=m}^{\infty}{k \choose m}\left(-x\right)^{k-m}A_{k}=\sum_{k=m}^{\infty}{k \choose m}\left(-y\right)^{k-m}B_{k}
\]

\end_inset

for each value of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 This should be solvable, as its upper-triangular.
 Write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{mk}^{(x)}=\begin{cases}
{k \choose m}\left(-x\right)^{k-m} & \quad\mbox{for }k\ge m\\
0 & \quad\mbox{for }k<m
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

so that we are solving
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}C_{mk}^{(x)}A_{k}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}C_{mk}^{(y)}B_{k}
\]

\end_inset

So 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{mk}^{(x)}$
\end_inset

 is upper-triangular, non-degenerate, and thus invertible.
 It is quasisingular, as it has all 1's on the diagonal.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset

 we get 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{km}^{(0)}=\delta_{km}$
\end_inset

 the identity operator.
 It would appear that we have almost complete freedom to choose 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{k}$
\end_inset

 at this point; see below.
 We can get an easy, intuitive feel for 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 by writing it out:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
1 & -x & x^{2} & -x^{3} & x^{4} & \cdots\\
0 & 1 & -2x & 3x^{2} & -4x^{3} & \cdots\\
\vdots & 0 & 1 & -3x & 6x^{2}\\
 & \vdots & 0 & 1 & -4x\\
 &  &  & 0 & 1\\
 &  &  &  &  & \ddots
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

which has both a left and right inverse given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{mk}^{(x)}=C_{mk}^{(-x)}
\]

\end_inset

Thus, the desired solution is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{m}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}C_{mk}^{(-x)}B_{k}
\]

\end_inset

Things seem to get funky here.
 Some care needs to be taken, here; we have the prior constraint that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{0}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{no}2^{-n}=x
\]

\end_inset

 and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{0}=y$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the first row gives:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=y+B_{1}x+B_{2}x^{2}+B_{3}x^{3}+\cdots
\]

\end_inset

Recall, both 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 are fixed, here, and the goal is to provide some reasonable values for
 B such that this sum converges, as well as the sums for all the other rows.
 Due to the presence of the binomial coefficient, these rows grow large,
 and it would be best to provide an a set of B's that shrink as fast as
 the factorial.
 Thus, a reasonable solution seems to be
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B_{k}=\frac{x-y}{k!(e^{x}-1)}
\]

\end_inset

which is flawed ...
 technically, this is a solution to the problem as originally stated, but...
 think of it this way: Fix y=0.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{k}$
\end_inset

 depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 but we want a solution that doesn't ...
 That is, this choice of B means that the expansion 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(w)$
\end_inset

 depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(w)=Y_{x}(w)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can we fix this with a sheaf of some kind? We've got a sheaf of analytic
 functions at 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and they were constructed to be consistent with the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{y}(u)$
\end_inset

.
 Can we do anything useful with this sheaf? What did we intend to do with
 it, in the first place?
