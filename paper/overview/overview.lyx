\layout Abstract

Fractals and Continued Fractions seem to be deeply related in many ways.
 Farey numbers appear naturally in both; chaotic systems behave in a fashion
 reminiscent of the Riemann Zeta.
 This paper attempts to illustrate some these relationships and possibly
 advance some tools that may make the study and classification of fractals
 easier.

Intro
\layout Standard

THIS IS A DRAFT WORK IN PROGRESS The intro hasn't been written yet, but
 if it was, it would drop topics like this:
\layout Standard

Farey Numbers show up naturally in the analysis of the Mandelbrot set.
 Farey numbers are used to label the treads of the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \htmlurl[devil's staircase]{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DevilsStaircase.html}

\end_inset 

, which is the set of mode-locked regions of the circle map.
 The devils staircase bears surprising resemblance to the continued fraction
 mapping.
\layout Standard

Here's a picture of the continued fraction mapping:

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

We need a picture of mode-locking too.
\layout Standard

We should mention Sinai's toungue's here, which are the mode-locking regions,
 and note that they can be approximated with continued fractions, which
 is something we will show below.
\layout Standard

It is the resemblance of these pictures that leads one naturally to the
 study of continued fractions.
 Thier connection to the Riemann Hypothesis through the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing
 operator is also interesting.
 See my other paper on this.

Continued Fractions and Gaps
\layout Standard

Let us start by directing the reader to te page
\begin_inset LatexCommand \htmlurl[Gap Theory]{http://www.linas.org/art-gallery/farey/continue/continue.html}

\end_inset 

, the contents of which need to be copied here.
 It provides some basic definitions that we need.
\layout Standard

Given a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $0<x<1$
\end_inset 

, a sequence of integers 
\begin_inset Formula $[a_{1},a_{2},...]$
\end_inset 

 can be found that define its continued-fraction expansion: 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
x=1/(a_{1}+1/(a_{2}+1/(a_{3}+...)))\]

\end_inset 

Given any x, this sequence is straightforward to compute.
 Rational numbers x always have a finite number of terms in the sequence.
 For a rational number x, there are two distinct expansions that yield the
 same value: 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{+}=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N}]\]

\end_inset 

and 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{-}=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N}-1,1]\]

\end_inset 

In the following text, we make a simplifying notational confusion: we use
 the same symbols to denote a sequence and its value when expressed as a
 continued fraction.
 Thus, for the above sequences, we may write 
\begin_inset Formula $x=x_{-}=x_{+}$
\end_inset 

.
 It will hopefully be obvious which is which.
 
\layout Standard

Given a rational 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 and an arbitrary complex number w, define new sequences: 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{+}(w)=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},1/w]\]

\end_inset 

and
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{-}(w)=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N}-1,1,1/w]\]

\end_inset 

These two functions are analytic in
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

, and can be expressed as the ratio of two polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, general analytic manipulations are perfectly well-defined on these
 functions.
 Clearly, 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{w\rightarrow0}x_{-}(w)=\lim_{w\rightarrow0}x_{+}(w)=x\]

\end_inset 

Differentiation w.r.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

 provides a handy tool for constructing various interesting things and proving
 various limits.
 We give an exact expression for these derivatives below.
 Although we've introduced w by appending it to the last term of a rational
 expansion, we could, if we wanted, introduce w into the N'th term of an
 irrational expansion.
 Most of the statements we make below are for rationals.
 This is in part because treating the irrationals is a bit harder and confusing,
 both in these formulas, and in their implementation as algorithms.
 
\layout Standard

There is also an even-odd symmetry for 
\begin_inset Formula $x(w)$
\end_inset 

 that we should be aware of, as it plays another important role in the theory.
 As we point out above, for any given sequence, there is a + and a - generalizat
ion.
 But what if the sequence is already 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{-}$
\end_inset 

 and we choose the - expansion? Then we get 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{--}=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N}-1,0,1]\]

\end_inset 

This expansion invokes a symmetry on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{-}(w)$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{--}(w)=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N}-1,0,1,1/w]=x_{+}(w)\]

\end_inset 

Thus, we see that a double-expansion is either idempotent or alternating.
 To be pedantic, we can complete this with the other three expressions:
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{++}(w)=x_{+}(w)$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{-+}(w)=x_{+-}(w)=x_{-}(w)$
\end_inset 

.
 In other words, a double-expansion reflects back, and, in this sense, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{+}$
\end_inset 

and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{-}$
\end_inset 

 are unique.
 
\layout Standard

If one needs to take differences, e.g.
 for derivatives, the even-odd expansion is more useful: Define 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e}(w)$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{o}(w)$
\end_inset 

 as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{e}(w)=\left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
x_{+}(w) & \text{if N even}\\
x_{-}(w) & \text{if N odd}\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

and
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{o}(w)=\left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
x_{-}(w) & \text{if N even}\\
x_{+}(w) & \text{if N odd}\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

These two have nice order-preserving properties: if 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

 is a positive real, then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{o}(w)<x_{e}(w)\]

\end_inset 

and, for negative real 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{o}(w)>x_{e}(w)\]

\end_inset 

These two functions also have idempotent or parity-swapping identities:
 
\layout Standard

xe+ = xe , xe- = xo , xo+ = xo , xo- = xe 
\layout Standard

xee = xe , xeo = xo , xoe = xe , xoo = xo 
\layout Standard

x+e = xe , x+o = xo , x-e = xe , x-o = xo 
\layout Standard

Let use define the 
\shape italic 
gap
\shape default 
 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma_{x}(w)=x_{e}(w)-x_{o}(w)\]

\end_inset 

This gap function is, of course, highly discontinuous.
 It is not hard to discover from numeric experiments that for a rational
 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

 reduced so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 have no common factors, and 
\begin_inset Formula $w\leq1$
\end_inset 

, the gaps take the form 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma_{p/q}(w)=\frac{w}{q^{2}}\left[2-w+\frac{w^{2}}{2}+\frac{w^{2}}{2}T_{p/q}(w)\right]\]

\end_inset 

 where the teeth 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset 

 are bounded: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|T_{p/q}(w)\right|<1$
\end_inset 

 (when 
\begin_inset Formula $w\leq1$
\end_inset 

).
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $w=0,$
\end_inset 

we have 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq T_{p/q}(0)\leq1$
\end_inset 

.
 Although these results are obvious numerically, its not clear to me if
 there is a simple proof for this (Homework: find this proof).
\layout Standard

The teeth at first appear to be random: below follows a scatterplot showing
 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset 

 for a thousand randomly generated small-ish rationals.
\layout Standard

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

However, closer examination reveals some surprising details.
 Here's the same picture, but this time showing only the rationals 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q=[1..719]/720$
\end_inset 

 (all rationals with numerator between 1 and 719 and denominator of 720:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename gappy-p720.png

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Note that 720 = 6! (six factorial) and that similar but denser images appear
 for higher factorials: Here's one for 
\begin_inset Formula $7!$
\end_inset 

 that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q=[1..5039]/5040$
\end_inset 

:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename gappy-p5040.png

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Notice that a Moire pattern of fringes seems to be forming at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset 

.
 The factorial in the denominator seems important: the picture for the denominat
or 
\begin_inset Formula $2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot11=2310$
\end_inset 

 blurs out the features, and mostly looks much more random, as shown below:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename gappy-p2310.png

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Now tht we know what sort of pattern to look for, we can find the cross-bars
 in this picture, for a denominator of 1024:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename gappy-p1024.png

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The analogous picture for a denominator consisting of powers of 3 is less
 distinct.
 Pictures for prime denominators appear considerably more random, although
 containing hints of a different kind of structure.
 For example, here is a picture with denominator 1023:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename gappy-p1023.png

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

There are more interesting things to be seen, but first we should provide
 a simpler expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p/q}(w)$
\end_inset 

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $w=0$
\end_inset 

.
 Recall that for any fixed rational 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

, that 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p/q}(w)$
\end_inset 

 is just a ratio of two polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

 with integer coefficients.
 The degree of the polynomials is 'reasonably low', essentially equal to
 the number of terms in the continued fraction for 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

.
 For any given, fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

, there exists an 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset 

 such that there are no poles in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p/q}(w)$
\end_inset 

 in the disk of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset 

 around 
\begin_inset Formula $w=0$
\end_inset 

 (Homework: prove this), and thus its analytic on this disk.
 This justifies an expansion in 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

.
 For the continued fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{+}(w)=[a_{1},a_{2},...a_{N},1/w]$
\end_inset 

 we write the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

'th partial convergent as 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{k}(w)=s_{k}+wt_{k}+w^{2}u_{k}+w^{3}v_{k}+...$
\end_inset 

 which obeys the recurrance relation 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{k-1}(w)=a_{k-1}+1/r_{k}(w)$
\end_inset 

 .
 Substituting, we get the explicit recurrance relations for each term:
\begin_inset Formula \[
s_{k-1}=a_{k-1}+1/s_{k}\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{k-1}=\frac{-t_{k}}{s_{k}^{2}}\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
u_{k-1}=\frac{-u_{k}}{s_{k}^{2}}+\frac{t_{k}^{2}}{s_{k}^{3}}\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
v_{k-1}=\frac{-v_{k}}{s_{k}^{2}}+2\frac{t_{k}u_{k}}{s_{k}^{3}}+\frac{-t_{k}^{3}}{s_{k}^{4}}\]

\end_inset 

 which are numerically quite tractable.
 The boundary conditions are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{+,N}(w)=a_{N}+w$
\end_inset 

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{+}$
\end_inset 

expansion, and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{-,N}(w)=a_{N}-w+w^{2}-w^{3}$
\end_inset 

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{-}$
\end_inset 

expansion.
 We add 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}\equiv0$
\end_inset 

 to terminate at the other end.
 Defining even and odd variants as before, we equate
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma_{p/q}(w)=w\left(t_{0}^{e}-t_{0}^{o}\right)+w^{2}\left(u_{0}^{e}-u_{0}^{o}\right)+w^{3}\left(v_{0}^{e}-v_{0}^{o}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Its becomes straightforward to numerically verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}^{e}-t_{0}^{o}=2/q^{2}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}^{e}-u_{0}^{o}=-1/q^{2}$
\end_inset 

 as we've noted before (Homework: provide a general proof).
 Far, far more curious is 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p/q}(0)=2q^{2}\left(v_{0}^{e}-v_{0}^{o}\right)-1$
\end_inset 

, of which we drew some pictures above.
 The pictures blow will provide some more surprises.
