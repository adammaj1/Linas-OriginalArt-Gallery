\layout Abstract

Fractals and Continued Fractions seem to be deeply related in many ways.
 Farey numbers appear naturally in both.
 The shape of the Devil's Staircase, which occurs in phase-locking dynamic
 maps, is reminiscent of the Minkowski Question Mark Function.
 This article attempts to establish that the natural symmetry group of both
 period-doubling maps and of phase-locking maps is the modular group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

, which expains these curious relationships.
 We classify certain fractals as beloning to different representations of
 this group; opening the door to a group-theoretical attack on fractals.
 As a byproduct, I think we expose a fantastic fractal symmetry on the rationals
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset 

 themselves, and thus presumably also on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$
\end_inset 

.
 This symmetry is never made use of in classical analysis, and probably
 not in non-Archimedean analysis either.
 It opens a whole set of new doors.
 An assortment of other curious observations is presented as well.
 Its a candy-store of surprises!

Intro
\layout Standard

THIS IS A DRAFT WORK IN PROGRESS.
 The intro hasn't been written yet, but if it was, it would work like this:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

I've been running a math-art website for over a decade and it's time some
 of the math behind it got an explanation.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 For my own benefit, if no one else's.
 So here it is.
\layout Standard

Farey Numbers show up naturally in the analysis of the Mandelbrot set.
 Farey numbers are used to label the treads of the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \htmlurl[devil's staircase]{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DevilsStaircase.html}

\end_inset 

, which is the set of mode-locked regions of the circle map.
 The devils staircase bears a general resemblance to the Minkowski Question
 Mark function.
 Maybe have small pictures of minkowski and devil's staircase here.
\layout Standard

We should mention Sinai's tongue's here, which are the mode-locking regions,
 and note that they can be approximated with continued fractions, which
 is something we will show below.
\layout Standard

It is the resemblance of these pictures that leads one naturally to the
 study of continued fractions.
 several remarkable things pop up: first, that Farey Numbers and continued
 fractions are deeply related, secondly, that Minkowski Question Mark provides
 a natural mapping to and from the Farey-number space, and finally, that
 the symmetry group of the Minkowski Question Mark is the Modular Group,
 as first pointed out by Georges de Rham in 1957
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-4}

\end_inset 

, who made this observation while studying a class of self-similar Takagi-like
 curves.
 It doesn't take long to realize that the modular group is 
\series bold 
*the*
\series default 
 symmetry group of a huge class of iterated maps, and can be applied to
 just about anything that exhibits period doubling or mode locking.
 In particular, this connection implies that one should explore interesting
 things in fractals, e.g.
 Misiurewicz points, and ask what they correspond to in the modular group.
 and etc.
 One then is lead to explore a veritable candy-store of possible connections
 between Modular Forms and Elliptic Curves and Fractals, and ask what each
 implies in the language of the other.
\layout Standard

To get from here to there, we'll try to take a mostly pedagogical approach,
 keeping things simple and accesible to an amateur mathematician or an attentive
 undergraduate math-major, using only basic group theory, algebra and analysis.

The Minkowski Question Mark Function
\layout Standard

This section explores a peculiar mapping involving Farey Numbers.
 Refered to as the Minkowski Question Mark, it is well-defined for all real
 numbers and maps the unit interval into, and onto, the unit interval.
 It is continuous and monotonic.
 The map, pictured below, is highly self-similar.
 It is also highly singular: all of its derivatives vanish on the rationals.
 Its self-similarity group can be clearly defined, and essentially that
 of period-doubling iterated maps, such as the Mandelbrot Set.
 The fact that it involves the Farey numbers is essentially the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

explanation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for why Farey Numbers occur in period-doubling maps.

\layout Subsection

Definition of the Question Mark Function
\layout Standard

The Minkowski Question Mark map can be constructed in several ways.
 In all of these constructions, it can be understood to be the mapping between
 the Stern-Brocot Tree (sometimes called the Farey Tree) and the tree of
 real numbers expressed as binary, base-2, dyadic fractions.
 The Stern-Brocot Tree is the tree on which the Farey mediants are naturally
 organized, and is most easily explained with a picture:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename fareytr.jpg

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

(See also the presenatation on 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[Stern Brocot Trees]{http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Stern.shtml}

\end_inset 

 at Cut-the-Knot.) The dyadic tree has the same shape, except that the second
 row holds the values 1/4 and 3/4, and the next row the values 1/8, 3/8,
 5/8 and 7/8, and so on.
 The dyadic tree holds values that are the arithmetic average, rather than
 the mediant, of the parent values.
 Both trees are 'binary' in the sense that each branch splits into two;
 we use the term 'dyadic tree' for the one that holds the 'dyadic' numbers
 
\begin_inset Formula $p/2^{k}$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

We denote the values of the Minkowski Question Mark function as as 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 Equating the Stern-Brocot Tree and the Dyadic Tree literally, one gets
 a recursive definition.
 Start by defining 
\begin_inset Formula $?(0)=0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $?(1)=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Then, for a pair of Farey fraction parents 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p'/q'$
\end_inset 

, it equates the Farey mediant to the arithmetic average:
\begin_inset Formula \[
?\left(\frac{p+p'}{q+q'}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left[?\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)+?\left(\frac{p'}{q'}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset 

Thus, starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{0}{1}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{1}$
\end_inset 

 at the root of the Farey Tree, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(\frac{0+1}{1+1}\right)=?\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left[?\left(\frac{0}{1}\right)+?\left(\frac{1}{1}\right)\right]=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 Next, we see the Farey number 1/3 is mapped to the binary 1/4, and so on:
 one quickly sees 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(1/n\right)=2^{-n+1}$
\end_inset 

.
 Similarly, 2/3 maps to 3/4, and 
\begin_inset Formula $?(n/(2n-1))=2^{-1}+2^{-n}$
\end_inset 

.
 In general, a rational 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

 maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $?(p/q)=m\cdot2^{-n}$
\end_inset 

 for some integers 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n$
\end_inset 

 (every rational occurs exactly once on the Stern-Brocot Tree).
 
\layout Standard

Put another way, given any value 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 on the Stern-Brocot Tree, 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the value at the corresponding position on the Dyadic Tree.
 It is convenient in the following to think of 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

 as a map from 'Farey Space' to 'Dyadic Space', and useful to keep in mind
 which of these two spaces one is currently working in.
 
\layout Standard

An alternate, non-recursive definition for the Question Mark is based on
 continued fractions.
 Starting with the expansion 
\begin_inset Formula $x=[a_{1},a_{2},...]$
\end_inset 

, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?(x)=2\sum_{k=1}\left(-1\right)^{k}\;2^{-(a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{k})}\]

\end_inset 

 This sum can be visualized as a count of an alternating sequence of 0's
 and 1's in the binary expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?(x)=\begin{array}{ccccc}
0.\underbrace{000...0} & \underbrace{11..1} & \underbrace{00..0} & \underbrace{11..1} & \underbrace{00..0}1..\\
a_{1}-1 & a_{2} & a_{3} & a_{4} & a_{5}\end{array}\]

\end_inset 

In this expnasion, it is useful to remember that 
\begin_inset Formula $0.111111...=1.0000...$
\end_inset 

, in case one has an odd number of terms in the continued fraction expansion.
\layout Standard

This sequence of 1's and 0's can be understood to be the set of directions
 for navigating a tree: on encountering a 0, take the left branch, else
 take the right branch.
 Thus, we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $0.011=LRR$
\end_inset 

.
 Navigating to this spot on the Stern-Brocot Tree, we find 2/5'ths.
 Navigating to this same position on the Dyadic Tree wee get 3/8'ths.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $?(2/5)=3/8$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

There is also a well-known representation of the Stern-Brocot Tree on the
 lattice 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z\mathbb{\times Z}}$
\end_inset 

, where a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

 is denoted as the ordered pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(p,q)$
\end_inset 

.
 In this representation, the left-right navigation operators 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset 

 have the values 
\begin_inset Formula $L=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & 1\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1\\
0 & 1\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset 

 and thus positions are given as elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 Maybe we'll elaborate on this later xxxx.
 To do...
 elaborate.
\layout Standard

To summarize, it is this expansion in binary digits that provides the underlying
 connection between period-doubling maps, such as the Mandelbrot Set, and
 Farey Numbers.
 Binary expansions, or code-words, occur naturally in the analysis of Duoady-Hub
bard landing rays.
 We'll demonstrate an explicit mapping in a later section.

Some Curious Properties of the Question Mark 
\layout Standard

The Question Mark has the curious property that it maps quadratic irrationals
 to rational numbers.
 A quadratic irrational is a number of the form m 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q+m\sqrt{D}/n$
\end_inset 

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $p,q,m,D,n$
\end_inset 

.
 Continued fractions whose expansions become eventually periodic are mapped
 to binary strings that become eventualy periodic.
 The later are clearly just the binary expansions of rationals whose denominator
 is not a power of 2.
 The former are quadratic irrationals, which is known from the theory of
 Pellian equations: It turns out that every quadratic irrational has a continued
 fraction expansion that becomes eventually periodic.
 Note that, as a side effect, this proves that quadratic irrationals are
 countable in the same way that rationals are.
\layout Standard

The Minkowski Question Mark has some very curious analytic properties: the
 mapping is continuous everywhere.
 It is also infinitely differentiable on every rational, and all derivatives
 vanish at every rational; yet the mapping is strictly montonically increasing.
 Clearly, the function is singular on irrationals.
 Its hard to define just how.
 (xxxx Blah blah need to define how).
\layout Standard

If there is a 3-adic or p-adic generalization of the Minkowski Question
 Mark, it is not obvious; one 'obvious' generalization is 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=1}\left(-1\right)^{k}\;3^{-(a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{k})}\]

\end_inset 

but its highly discontinuous.
 Other generalizations based on roots of unity in the complex plane also
 don't seem to work.
 One might be able to get traction by looking at groups that have 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

 as a subroup but also have some 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

-fold symmetry.
\layout Subsection

Symmetries of the Question Mark
\layout Standard

XXX write the intro again:...
 the symmetry is the group that maps trees to subtrees so the symmetry group
 of maping a binary tree onto itself in the modular group.
 XXX rewrite me.
 XXX also notice that the tree spans an inf-sup interval which is why this
 is an interval map and notice that trees don't span any arbitrary interval,
 but very specific intervals.
 
\layout Standard

It should be immediately appearent from the picture of the Question Mark
 that it is highly self-similar, and thus should have a group of symmetries.
 Below, we give an explicit presentation of this group, which turns out
 to be the Modular Group Gamma.
 After breifly presenting the modular group a bit, we point out that the
 'interesting' subset of the group, that is, 'interesting' as far as fractals
 are concerned, can be best enumerated as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\otimes\mathbb{N}\otimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 This enumeration will help cement that the modular group is the symmetry
 group of the Mandelbrot Set.
 I'm enamored of this development, because the popular literature on fractals
 always talks about self-similarity without ever actually giving the group
 structure that's involved.
 The goal here is to rectify this omission.
 
\layout Standard

We start by noticing that for any real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 having the continued fraction expansion 
\begin_inset Formula $x=[a_{1},a_{2},...]$
\end_inset 

, that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)=x/(1+x)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},...]$
\end_inset 

 .
 By the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

 one sees immediately that 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 is a homomorphism of the Question Mark: 
\begin_inset Formula $(?\circ g)(x)=?(g(x))=?(x)/2$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 represents one of the generators of the symmetry group.
 Denoting repeated iterations of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{n}$
\end_inset 

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{n}(x)=x/(1+nx)$
\end_inset 

.
 Equivalently, for a continued fraction, we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{n}([a_{1},a_{2},..])=[a_{1}+n,a_{2},...]\]

\end_inset 

 Iterating under the questino mark gives 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x/(1+nx))=?(x)/2^{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 The generator 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 maps intervals to intervals, specifically 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{n}:[[0,1]]\rightarrow[[0,\frac{1}{n+1}]]$
\end_inset 

 where we use the non-standard notation 
\begin_inset Formula $[[]]$
\end_inset 

 to denote an interval, to avoid confusion with 
\begin_inset Formula $[]$
\end_inset 

 for continued fraction expansions.
 On the dyadic side, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $(?g^{n}):[[0,1]]\rightarrow[[0,1/2^{n}]]$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

One gets the general symmetry group 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset 

 by combining with the reflection operator embodied in the left-right symmetry:
 
\begin_inset Formula $?(1-x)=1-?(x)$
\end_inset 

 which we denote with 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x)=1-x$
\end_inset 

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 commutes with 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset 

 as we have 
\begin_inset Formula $(?\circ r)(x)=(r\circ?)(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(?rg^{n})(x)=(r?g^{n})(x)=r\left(\frac{1}{2^{n}}?\right)(x)=1-?(x)/2^{n}=?\left(r\left(\frac{x}{1+nx}\right)\right)=?\left(\frac{1+(n-1)x}{1+nx}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $rg^{n}$
\end_inset 

 is the group element that, under 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset 

, maps 
\begin_inset Formula $[[0,1]]\rightarrow[[1,1-1/2^{n}]]$
\end_inset 

.
 We can now write a general group element as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\equiv g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}}$
\end_inset 

.
 Applying the above process, it is relatively straightforward to see that
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(?\gamma)(x)=(?g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}})(x)=\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}}}-\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}}}+\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}}}-...+(-)^{N+1}\frac{?(x)}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+...+a_{N}}}\]

\end_inset 

 To see the other leg of the homomorphism commuative diagram, we start by
 observing that we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{n}(x)$
\end_inset 

 itself as a continued fraction: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{n}(x)=\frac{1}{n+\frac{1}{x}}=[n,x]\]

\end_inset 

 In the same vein, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $(rg^{n})(x)=[1,n-1,x]$
\end_inset 

 and, with a slight abuse:
\begin_inset Formula \[
r(x)=\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{-1+\frac{1}{x}}}=[1,-1,x]\]

\end_inset 

 Continuing this excercise, one finds that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma(x)=(g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}})(x)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{N-1},a_{N}-1,x]\]

\end_inset 

 which is recognizable as an element of the group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 We present this group next.
\layout Subsection

The Modular Group Gamma or 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The modular group gamma is normally defined by its canonical representation
 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 In this standard representation, a general group element is representated
 by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a & b\\
c & d\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c,d$
\end_inset 

 being integers, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\gamma=ad-bc=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Elements of this group are isomorphic to a certain set of Mobius transforms
 on the upper-half complex plane; the isomorphism is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(x)=(ax+b)/(cx+d)$
\end_inset 

.
 The group elements are generated by a pair of generators.
 One generator generates the cyclic group of two elements 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}\equiv\mathbb{Z}/\left(2\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

 and the other generates the subgroup 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset 

.
 One can choose several different representations for the generators; the
 choice that is consistent with the previous section is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & 1\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and }\; r=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 1\\
0 & 1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 This matrix representation of the generators can be used to manipulate
 and evaluate continued fractions; indeeed, the modular group is known as
 being one way to conveniently work with continued fractions.
 So, for example, we've already noted above that
\begin_inset Formula \[
g([a_{1},a_{2},...])=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},...]\]

\end_inset 

 Similarly, the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 is can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
r([a_{1},a_{2},..])=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
\;[1,a_{1}-1,a_{2},..] & \;\textrm{\; for \;} & a_{1}\neq1\\
\;[a_{2}+1,a_{3},...] & \textrm{\;\; for \;} & a_{1}=1\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

The operator to insert a digit 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq1$
\end_inset 

 at the front of the continued fraction expansion is thus 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(g^{n-1}rg)([a_{1},a_{2},...])=[n,a_{1},a_{2},...]\]

\end_inset 

which we can immediately verify as
\begin_inset Formula \[
(g^{n-1}rg)(x)=\left(\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
n-1 & 1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 1\\
0 & 1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & 1\end{array}\right)\right):(x)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
1 & n\end{array}\right):(x)=\frac{1}{n+x}\]

\end_inset 

 Here we introduced 
\begin_inset Formula $:$
\end_inset 

 to denote the apply operator for the matrices; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a & b\\
c & d\end{array}\right):(x)=\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\]

\end_inset 

 It should be clear that we can now build up the continued fraction as desired
 with this insertion operator acting on zero: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(g^{j-1}rg)(g^{k-1}rg)(g^{m-1}rg)...(x)=(g^{j-1}rg^{k}rg^{m}rg...)(x)=[j-1,k,m,...,x]\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

One can also find the append operator, which we find by examining
\begin_inset Formula \[
[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},g^{k}(x)]=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N}+k,x]\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},r(x)]=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N}+1,-1,x]\]

\end_inset 

 We use these to construct the appending operator 
\begin_inset Formula $(g^{-1}rg^{k+1})(x)=(kx+1)/x$
\end_inset 

 which, for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq1$
\end_inset 

, acts as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},(g^{-1}rg^{k+1})(x)]=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},k,x]\]

\end_inset 

 We can thus build up continued fractions by appending at the back, starting
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $(g^{-1}rg)(x)=1/x=[x]$
\end_inset 

 as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(g^{-1}rg)(g^{-1}rg^{j+1})(g^{-1}rg^{k+1})(g^{-1}rg^{m+1})...(x)=(g^{j}rg^{k}rg^{m}rg...)(x)=[j,k,m,...,x]\]

\end_inset 

 arriving at the same answer as before.

A Theorm about an Isomorphism
\layout Standard

Lets restate the above results using modern mathematical notation and language.
 Let us denote with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 the set of real numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 that are represented by dyadic expansions; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\;\exists x_{D}\in\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 which represents the real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 as the dyadic expansion 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{D}$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{D}=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}b_{n}2^{n}\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} \;\forall k\in\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset 

.
 Let us use the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

 to denote the representation of the real numbers as continued fractions,
 that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\;\exists x_{C}\in\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{C}=a_{0}+\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2+...}}}=[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},...]\]

\end_inset 

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}\in\mathbb{N}\;\forall k\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

.
 Both of these sets are commonly treated as being isomorphic to the real
 numbers; they are just different representations of the real numbers.
 However, we can see that these two are not completely the same, because
 the group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

 has a different action on each.
 In particular, the group generator 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 has the representation 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\layout Description

Proof: We've already given the standard representations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 in these two spaces in previous sections, but we repeat these here just
 so that this is all crystal-clear.
 We first decompose an abstract group element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

 in terms of the generators 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

, as usual: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}}\]

\end_inset 

 Then, this 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 has the representation 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{D}$
\end_inset 

 which is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma_{D}(x)=\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}}}-\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}}}+\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}}}-...+(-)^{N+1}\frac{x}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+...+a_{N}}}\]

\end_inset 

 and it also has the representation 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{C}$
\end_inset 

 which is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma_{C}(x)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{N-1},a_{N}-1,x]\]

\end_inset 

 and thus we are able to write 
\begin_inset Formula $?(\gamma_{C}(x))=\gamma_{D}(?(x))$
\end_inset 

 as the isomorphism.
 To properly complete this proof, we would need to apply induction, that
 is, to show that if this equivalence holds for any one given 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

, then it also holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\gamma'$
\end_inset 

 for another 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma'\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

 and that it also holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $x+y$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

.
 We then would need to exhibit one group element for which this holds, and
 thus, by induction, conclude that it holds for all group elements and reals.
 One could try to give a very precise proof along these lines, but this
 is outside the scope of this text.
 It requires, among other things, talking about the completion of the rationals
 by the reals, and, if we are not careful, might also invoke the Axiom of
 Choice.
 See also the remarks below.
 QED.
 
\layout Standard

To summarize, we have exhibited an isomorphism of the real numbers onto
 themselves that demonstrates that there are really two distinct and inequivalen
t representations of the real numbers.
 When we say distinct and inequivalent, we really mean it: these two representat
ions transform radically differently under the Modular Group, although they
 are both isomorphic to that abstract set we call the reals, and are, through
 the Question Mark, isomorphic to each other.
\layout Standard

If we were better mathematicians, we would insist on a more watertight proof
 of this isomorphism, rather than the assertion that this is so.
 Unfortunately, we do not have the tools handy to provide this stronger
 proof.
 It is widely beleived that both the dyadics and the continued fractions
 are isomorphic to the reals, but this shouldn't entirely be taken for granted.
 In fact, we have already commited several grave errors.
 For one, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 is larger than the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

: as every student is told, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 contains the elements 0.11111...
 and 1.0000...
 which are clearly distinct in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 but represent the same number in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

.
 We have something similar happening in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

 in that a rational has the multiple representations 
\begin_inset Formula $[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n},\infty,a_{n+2},a_{n+3},...]$
\end_inset 

 where it does not matter what we pick for 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n+2}$
\end_inset 

, etc.
 Thus, one of our mistakes was to say 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 is isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

.
 Instead, it is only homomorphic, and there exists a homomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $e:\mathbb{R}_{D}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $e(0.1111...)=e(1.000...)$
\end_inset 

, thus implying that 
\begin_inset Formula $Ker\; e$
\end_inset 

 is non-trivial.
 We can then use 
\begin_inset Formula $Ker\; e$
\end_inset 

 to induce the desired isomorphism between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

.
 The existance of this homomorphism is widely accepted, but I don't know
 how to get there from first principles.
 Similar remarks apply to the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, having to work with quotient spaces introduces complexity into the
 correct proof.
 To this volatile mix, we have to add considerations of about the completion
 of the rationals by the reals.
 Clearly, the dyadic tree and the Stern-Brocot tree are order-preserving
 enumerations of the rationals.
 The correct completion of the dyadic tree appears to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 whereas the correct completion of the Stern-Brocot Tree appears to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

, and these two completions are not 
\emph on 
prima facae
\emph default 
 equivalent.
 If we can prove that there is only one, unique completion of the rationals
 by the reals, then we have proved the existance of the Minkowski Question
 Mark, and we thus arrive at the proof of the homomorphism of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

.
 But this is far from obvious from this vantage point.
 One problem is that proofs of completion might surreptiously invoke the
 Axiom of Choice; what one really wants are proofs of completion that start
 from a clean base, such as Zermelo-Fraenkel, and arrive at the homomorphism
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

, without invoking the Axiom of Choice.
 We start laying some of the groundwork for a proof of this type in a later
 section.

Fractal Symmetry and the Subset 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\otimes\mathbb{N}\otimes C_{2}$
\end_inset 

 of the Modular Group
\layout Standard

Every group element of 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

 can be decomposed into a combination of the 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 generators, of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}}$
\end_inset 

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}\in\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset 

.
 We've already discovered the relationship between the modular group and
 continued fractions, which we gave above as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma(x)=(g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}})(x)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{N-1},a_{N}-1,x]\]

\end_inset 

 We saw that this relation gives us the isomorphisms of the Minkowski Question
 Mark; let us now look at this a little more crefully and precisely, since,
 among other things, we need to define the domain and range over which the
 isomorphism is valid.
\layout Standard

First, let us consider the group elements with 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}\geq0$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{2}\geq1$
\end_inset 

, ...
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N-1}\geq1$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}\geq0$
\end_inset 

.
 When the coefficients are zero or positive like this, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(x)$
\end_inset 

 maps the unit interval into strictly small intervals; 
\shape italic 
i.e.

\shape default 
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\gamma(0),\gamma(1)<1$
\end_inset 

.
 One endpoint of the interval are given by the rational 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(0)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{N-1}]$
\end_inset 

 (note the missing 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}$
\end_inset 

).
 The other endpoint is 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(1)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{N}]$
\end_inset 

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}\geq1$
\end_inset 

, although it must be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(1)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{N-2}]$
\end_inset 

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}=0$
\end_inset 

.
 This last special case is really just a reversal of the two endpoints.
 For such a 'shrinking' 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

, we can now write the isomorphism of the question mark as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?(\gamma(x))=?(\gamma(0))+\frac{\left(-1\right)^{N+1}}{\left(2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{N}}\right)}?(x)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The best way of understanding this isomorphism is to think of it as an isomorphi
sm of intervals, where we can pick one end of the interval, but are a bit
 more constrained in picking the other end.
 That is, we can pick an arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(0)=p/q\in\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset 

.
 We get the other end of the interval by picking 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

 a positive integer.
 Having thus specified the interval, we can, for good measure, choose to
 exchange the endpoints, that is, pick one of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1,r\right\} \in C_{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

XXXX explain this: there are two ways to enumerate the tree remaps: tree-root
 to -tree-root.
 But the intervals are inf and sup of all the elements in the tree.
 The alternate map is to specify the inf of the tree (which is actually
 a real not a rational!!!) in which case one has a choice of tree roots,
 which are Z.
 The mirror reflection of the tree is of couse 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 XXXX reword the above XXXX 
\layout Standard

To summarize, this set of isomorphisms of the question mark can be enumerated
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\otimes\mathbb{N}\otimes C_{2}$
\end_inset 

, which we'd like to call the fundamental set of symmetries.
 Note that this property of being able to freely pick one endpoint, but
 being a bit more contstrained with the other is a very important property
 of this symmetry.

So far, we've only enumerated some, but not all of the modular group.
 The inverse of our generator 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
-1 & 1\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 For the group element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}}$
\end_inset 

 we can quickly see that the inverse is 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{-1}=g^{-a_{N}}rg^{-a_{N-1}}r...rg^{-a_{1}}$
\end_inset 

.
 Its easy to see that these define the inverse mappings of smaller intervals
 onto the unit interval.
 Note that one needs to be careful when working with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{-1}(x)$
\end_inset 

 because this has poles that are just outside of the interval of the mapping.
 That is, the domain of the isomorphism is defined only on the interval
 of the mapping, and not the whole unit interval (its the range, not the
 domain, that is the whole unit interval).
 These inverse mappings can also be enumerated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\otimes\mathbb{N}\otimes C_{2}$
\end_inset 

, of course.
 
\layout Standard

All of the remaining group elements that we haven't yet discussed are those
 with a mixture of positive and negative values for the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset 

.
 These group elements can be obtained by alternately concatenating interval-shri
nking and interval-expanding group elements.
 One has to be considerably more careful in keeping track of the domains
 and ranges of each mapping.
 We claim (without proof at this time) that these types of mappings do not
 introduce any new types of intervals, and so enumeration originally provided,

\begin_inset Formula $(rg^{-2}rg^{2})(x)=x+2$

 this (to modulo or not to modulo?)
\layout Standard

Note also that if we limit ourselves to alternately shrinking and growing
 interval maps that are stricly contained one inside the other, then we
 find a proper subroup of the modular group, whose group elements are now
 enumerated by pairs of intervals or .xxx.
 be careful here .
 Again, the domain and range of these sub-symmetries are now limited.
 
\layout Standard

Thus I think we can now conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 is an isomorphism of 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset 

, mapping the unit interval into a subinterval, completing the proof.

Hyperbolic Rotations of Binary Trees
\layout Standard

Note that by imposing the modular group symmetry on the real number line,
 we've essentially introduced a hyperbolic manifold that is homomorphic
 to the real-number line.
 The existance of this hyperbolic manifold and its negative curvature esentially
 'explains' why trajectories of iterated functions have positve Lyapunov
 exponents.
 Of course they do, since thier 'true' trajectories should be consideed
 to live on the hyperbolic manifold rather than on the real-number line.
 We try to make this clear below.
 
\layout Standard

One can get a much better sense of the hyperbolic nature induced by this
 symmetry group by looking at the discrete 'rotations' of the binary tree.
 Rotations are frequently used in computer science algorithms to rebalance
 finite binary trees while at the same time preserving the order of the
 elements in the tree.
 We can think of a rotation as kind of like draping the flexible, droopy
 tree over a peg, letting gravity do its job, and declaring the node on
 the peg as the new root of the tree.
 In fact, we have to do a bit of minor surgery to get this right; we ave
 to cut a branch and re-attach it at the free spot where the old root used
 to be.
 
\layout Standard

Thus for example, lets rotate the dyadic tree so that the node at 1/4 becomes
 the new root.
 We do this by chopping off the tree rooted at 3/8'ths and re-attaching
 at as the left subtree of the old root at 1/2.
 (xxx we desperately need a diagram here) Denoting this rotation with the
 symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

, we have an isomorphism of trees: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{4}\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)=\frac{1}{8}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\theta\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)=\frac{1}{16}\;\;\;\;\;\theta\left(\frac{3}{8}\right)=\frac{3}{16}\;\;\;\;\;\theta\left(\frac{5}{8}\right)=\frac{3}{8}\;\;\;\;\;\theta\left(\frac{7}{8}\right)=\frac{3}{4}\]

\end_inset 

 and the rest of the tree hanging as normal under these nodes.
 Its not hard to see that this rotation is order-preserving, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(x)<\theta(y)$
\end_inset 

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $x<y$
\end_inset 

 and ths monotonic, one-to-one and onto.
 This is the strecth-and-shrink map
\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
x/2 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 0\leq x\leq1/2\\
x-1/4 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 1/2\leq x\leq3/4\\
2x-1 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 3/4\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

 which is stretching in one interval and shrinking in another.
 Since we've seen that the Modular Group maps intervals to intervals, some
 stretching and some shrinking, we immediately recognize that three group
 elements were used to construct this map.
 Since we've already enumerated the modular group in terms of maps of intervals,
 we see that the three different group elements making up this map are the
 one that re-parented the 1/8 tree at 1/4, the 3/8 tree at 5/8 and the 3/4
 tree at 7/8.
 In terms of tree surgery, it is enough to specify these three remapings,
 as the rest of the binary trees hanging below are structurally unaltered.
 Note that the 3/8'ths to 5/8'ths mapping does not change the denominator:
 this map neither stretches nor shrinks, its a lateral translation.
 
\layout Standard

Note that the map is clearly invertible, with its inverse being 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta^{-1}(x)=xxx\]

\end_inset 

 Notice that the shrinking portion of the map is just the inverse of the
 stretching portion of the map.
 Iterating these maps just makes them even more hyperbolic.

We demonstate a more complex mapping by rebalancing the binary tree so that
 the 3/8 node becomes root.
 This requires two tree movements: switching the 7/16 node so that it lives
 under 1/2, and switching the 5/16 node so that it lives under the now empty
 slot at 1/4.
 This is shown in the diagram (xxx need to create the pretty-picture of
 the rotated tree xxx).
 This rotation is given by the mapping 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\eta(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
x & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 0\leq x\leq1/4\\

 These maps consited of straight line segments, with each segments corresponding

\layout Standard

This mapping and method of counting on the buds is well-known in the literature
 and is explored in many ways.
\layout Standard

Next we note that enumerating the group elements of the modular group as
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q\times\mathbb{N}}$
\end_inset 

 plays directly into the celebrated self-similarity of the Mandelbrot set.
\layout Standard

What does this mean for the symmetries of the Mandelbrot set? it means that
 the modular group maps buds to buds.
 Note, however, that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q\times\mathbb{N}}$
\end_inset 

 parameterization of the modular group means that one can map one bud onto
 any another, but that the mapping has to be onto the whole bud, and not
 just a portion of it.
 Put another way, it is a mapping of intervals to intervals.
 However, we can't just map any-old-interval anywhere we want.
 We can map an interval to any starting point that we wish (this is the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset 

 part of the symmetry, but after specifying the starting point, we have
 only a discrete set of intrvals we can map to: this is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

 part of the enumeration.
 The buds appear discretely on the boundaries of the main cardiod.

Mandelbrot Set; Douady-Hubbard Rays
\layout Standard

Douady Hubbard rays are a mapping of the unit circle to the boundary of
 the Mandelbrot Set.
 One of the properties is that a pair of rays pinches off each bud of the
 M-Set.
 Note that both of the rays occur at external angles that are also rationals.
 This now induces some additional symmetries on the rational numbers, since
 each bud can be labelled with a rational, and thus, for each rational,
 we associate the upper and lower rays.
 These two map are highly discontinuous.
 But that is OK, because the discontinuities pinch off the bud in the middle.
 We use the code-word substituion techniques of Doaudy-Hubbard to paste
 into the discontinuities.
 Since we are free to paste in any code-word desired, we have, in a certain
 sense, total and complete randomness, which is then propagated everywhere
 through the self-similarity.
 
\layout Standard

Here is a bizarro philosophical thought: we have complete freedom to choose
 the codewords to be pasted into the period-doubling symmetry, in the sense
 of philosophical free-will: we can choose as we wish.
 The result of the application of our free will is multiplied through the
 modular group so that choice now appears everywhere among the rationals.
 But we know that the closure of rationals is the reals, and we know that
 the reals are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

unknowable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the Turing-computable sense.
 Thus, we conclde that the application of free-choice results in something
 unknowable.
 How strange.
 
\layout Standard

Here's how code-word substitution works: start with the dyadic (base-2)
 expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq x\leq1$
\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
x=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{2^{n}}=0.a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}...\]

\end_inset 

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset 

 can only take on the values 0 and 1.
 Then pick any two integers 
\begin_inset Formula $h,l\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

 and a third integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $h,l<2^{m}$
\end_inset 

 is satisfied (alternately, we start by picking 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset 

 first, then picking 
\begin_inset Formula $h,l$
\end_inset 

 to satisfy this).
 We then substitute the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset 

 in the dyadic expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset 

 and the binary value of 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset 

 in the expansion with 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset 

, padding each appropriately:
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{h,l,m}(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{ha_{n}+l(1-a_{n})}{2^{n}2^{nm}}\]

\end_inset 

 which we now see as a highly discontinuous function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

.
 To get a better idea of why its called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

codeword substitution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, lets work an example.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.10101010101..._{2}$
\end_inset 

 and pick 
\begin_inset Formula $m=4$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h=7$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l=4$
\end_inset 

.
 Note that, in binary, 
\begin_inset Formula $h=0111_{2}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l=0100_{2}$
\end_inset 

 and so we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{7,3;4}(0.1010101..._{2})=0.0111\;0100\;0111\;0100\;0111\;..._{2}\]

\end_inset

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?([2,3,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3,1,1,...])=B_{7,3;4}(0.1010101..._{2})\]

Iterating on the Hyperbolic Plane
\layout Standard

Of course, now that we know about the modular group and the hyperbolic plane,
 we state that we really want to study the iteration of one-dimensional
 maps like the logistic equation or the tent map by studying how it bounces
 around on the fundamental domain.
 That is, each time we iterate a 1-D map, we are bounced to somewhere else
 on the unit interval.
 This point on the unit interval is included in an enumerable set of line
 segments, which can be maped back to the whole unit interval via the modular
 group.
 Thus, a single point is a representative element of the equivalence class
 of all the points that the modular group maps it to.
 We want to study how the logistic equation acts on these equivalence classes,
 instead of asking how it acts on single points.
\layout Standard

Blah Blah Blah.
 Define what equivalence class means when a group acts on a set.
 viz define the quotient space.
 
\layout Standard

This is essentially how we get related to Julia sets.
 After we iterate a map like the logistic map once, we then ask what other
 points are in the same equivalence class, under the action of the modular
 group.
 That is, we now studay iteration in the quotient space, where the modular
 group provides the quotient.
 This quotient map is just the map of all hyperbolic triangles back to the
 fundamental domain.
 And so we really study iteration in this quotient space.
 Blah blah.
 Provide pretty pictures.
 We now ask what do the points on the boundary of the fundamental domain
 correspond to, blah blah, these are the Misiurewicz points, which is why
 they relate to Julia sets; they essentially paste together the pieces.

Distributions of Rational Numbers
\layout Standard

Blah Blah, we go back to do some fundamentals.
 The idea is to start exploring the tools we can use to relate the real
 numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 to both 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

.
 We've already seen that the measure of the distribution of dyadic numbers
 on the real-number line has something funny going on.
 Here, we'll look at the distribution of the Farey numbers on the (dyadic-measur
e) real-number line.
 We'll promptly see that this distribution is the first derivative of the
 Minkowski Question Mark, which is perhaps not surprising if we think of
 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset 

 as the map 
\begin_inset Formula $?:\mathbb{R}_{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 and thus the distribution is the Jacobean of this map.
\layout Standard

Next we introduce the Frobenius-Perrron operator of an iterated function
 map, hoping to use this as a mechanism to gain insight into the structure
 of the Bernoulli map 
\begin_inset Formula $b(x)=2x-\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor $
\end_inset 

 which is used to generate the dyadic numbers, and the truncation map 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)=1/x-\left\lfloor 1/x\right\rfloor $
\end_inset 

 which is used to generate continued fractions.
\layout Subsection

Distribution of Rationals in the Farey Tree
\layout Standard

One way to enumerate all of the rationals is by placing them on the Farey
 Tree (or the Stern-Brocot Tree).
 One can prove that the Farey Tree enumerates all of the rationals in the
 unit interval exactly once (Proof at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \htmlurl[Cut-the-Knot]{http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Stern.shtml}

\end_inset 

).
 However, the distribution of the rationals on the Farey Tree is highly
 non-uniform, if we walk that tree breadth-first.
 The graph below shows that distribution.
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Superficially, the shape of this curve seems independent of the bining;
 although, upon very close inspection, one can see that is not quite true.
 In particular, one can deduce that in the limit of an 'infinite' number
 of bins, that this 'curve' is equal to exactly zero at every rational 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

, and infinite at every irrational.
 But no matter; for a finite number of bins, we can proceed.
\layout Standard

This shape is remarkably suggestive.
 It appears to be the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $?'(x)=d?(x)/dx$
\end_inset 

 of the continued fraction mapping, although using classical analytic techniques
, this derivative is not definable.
 Indeed, performing a simple numeric integral of the above, and comparing
 it to the exact expression shows a perfect match, as witnessed in the graph
 below.
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename farey-integral.png

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The continued fraction mapping is infinitely differentiable on every rational,
 and all derivatives vanish at every rational; yet the mapping is strictly
 montonically increasing.
 Just examing the graph visually suggests that the derivatives must be non-zero
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

somewhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, although its hard to define how to value these derivatives.
 Yet, visually comparing the Farey mapping to the distribution of the Farey
 Fractions, it seems that the distribution of Farey's might be a good estimate
 of that first derivative.
 Clearly, classical analytic techniques are sorely lacking and inapplicable;
 we need to find a set of tools where we can talk about and manipulate the
 so-called 'first derivative' in a meaningful way.
\layout Standard

Below is another curious picture, where we've relabelled the x axis by passing
 it through 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$

This function appears to vanish only at the dyadics.
 Note the superficial resemblance of the profile to the Takagi curve.
 By visually comparing this function and the Takagi curve (also called the
 
\emph on 
blancmange curve
\emph default 
), one can intuitively sense that there must be some tangent-space-to-Exp-space
 type relation between the two.
 The trick is to write down this relation.
 
\layout Standard

This is really a very curious circumstance.
 The above graphs show only the distribution of a finite number of points
 (they were, after all, computer generated).
 A finite set of points on the real number line is zero; yet we are using
 it to induce a measure that can be used for integration.
 How is this? The statistical properties of a finite sampling provide us
 with information about the limit.
 Its as if we were working with an anti-Cantor-set construction: we start
 with a dust, and average over intervals to discover analytic properties.

The Frobenius-Perron Operator
\layout Standard

This section provides a basic review of the Frobenius-Perron operator and
 its use in the description of fractals and chaotic iterated maps.
 No results are presented here; rather the goal is to provide the background
 for later sections.
 
\layout Standard

The Frobenius-Perron operator of a function provides a tool for studying
 the dynamics of the iteration of that function.
 If one only studies how a point value jumps around during iteration, one
 gets a very good sense of the point dynamics but no sense of how iteration
 acts on non-point sets.
 If the iterated function is applied on a continuous, possibly even smooth
 density, then one wants to know how that smooth density evolves over repeated
 iteration.
 
\layout Standard

If we consider a smooth density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset 

 as a set of values on a collection of points, we can take each point and
 iterate it to find its new location, and then assign the old value to the
 new location.
 Of course, after iteration, several points may end up at the same location,
 at which point we need to add thier values together.
 Lets write the new density as 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}(x)$
\end_inset 

, with the subscript 1 denoting we've iterated once.
 We can express this idea of iterating the underlying points, and then assigning
 thier old values to new locations as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\rho_{1}(x)=\int dy\;\delta\left(x-g(y)\right)\;\rho(y)\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the iterated function.
 To get 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{n}(x)$
\end_inset 

, one simply repeats the proceedure 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 times.
 In more abstract notation, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{g}\rho\right](x)=\rho_{1}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 to denote this time evolution.
 The notation here emphasizes that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}:\; f\mapsto U_{g}f$
\end_inset 

 is an operator that maps functions to functions: written formally, we have
 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}:\mathcal{F\mathcal{\rightarrow F}}$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}=\left\{ f\;|\; f:\mathbb{\mathbb{R\rightarrow}R}\right\} $
\end_inset 

 is the set of all functions.
 In analyzing 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

, we will often be interested in how it acts on the subset of square-integrable
 functions, or possibly just 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\infty}$
\end_inset 

 functions or polynomials or the like.
 Repeated iteration just gives the time-evolution of the the density; that
 is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
U_{g}^{n}\rho\equiv\begin{array}{c}
\underbrace{U_{g}\circ U_{g}\circ...\circ U_{g}}\\
n\textrm{ times}\end{array}\;\circ\rho=\rho_{n}\]

\end_inset 

 where iteration is just ordinary operator multiplication.
 
\layout Standard

To understand 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

, one typically tries to understand its spectrum, that is, its eigenvalues
 and eigenfunctions.
 In most cases, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 is contractive in that it has one eigenvalue equal to one and all the other
 eigenvalues are real and smaller than one.
 However, one must be terribly careful here, as there are land-mines strewn
 about: the actual spectrum, and the nature of the eigenvalues, depends
 very much on the function space choosen.
 Typically, when acting on polynomials, one gets discrete, real eigenvalues
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

.
 When acting on square-integrable functions, one seems to usually get a
 continuous set of complex-valued eigenvalues.
 This is because one can often find shift-states 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{n}$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}\psi_{n}=\psi_{n-1}$
\end_inset 

, in which case one can construct eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(z)=\sum_{n}z^{n}\psi_{n}$
\end_inset 

 whose complex eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 form the unit disk.
 It is often considered to be a mistake to try to analyse 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 acting on a finite grid of discrete points, such as one might try on a
 computer: it is all to easy to turn this into an excercise of analysing
 the permutation group on a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

 elements, of which any student knows that the eigenvalues are the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

'th roots of unity.
 
\layout Standard

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 is a linear operator, it induces a homomorphism in its mapping, and so
 one should study its kernel 
\begin_inset Formula $Ker\; U_{g}=\left\{ f\;|\; U_{g}f=0\right\} $
\end_inset 

 to gain insights into its symmetry as well as to express more correctly
 the quotient space.
 Insofar as the iterated map might represent a dynamical system, one knows
 that symmetries lead to conserved currents, via Noether's theorm, and sometimes
 to topologically-conserved (quantum) numbers, winding numbers or other
 invarients.
 
\layout Standard

Finally, we note that since 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 looks like a time-evolution operator, we are tempted to write
\begin_inset Formula \[
U_{g}^{t}=\exp\; tH_{g}\]

\end_inset 

 for some other operator 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{g}$
\end_inset 

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

 is in general not unitary, 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset 

 is not (anti-)Hermitian.
 As before, describing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset 

 is a useful excercise.
 Also, any group of symmetries on 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

 should express themselves as an algebra on 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset 

 and these might provide an alternate path for exploring and describing
 the fractal in question.
\layout Standard

In practice, when one is given an iterated map 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset 

, one computes the Frobenius-Perron operator as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{g}\rho\right](x)=\sum_{x':x=g(x')}\frac{\rho(x')}{\left|dg(x')/dx'\right|}\]

\end_inset 

 which provides an expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 acting on a general function 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset 

.
 If one is interested in 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

 acting on polynomial or 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\infty}$
\end_inset 

 functions, then one immediately writes the Taylor (or McLauren) series
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\rho(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\rho^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^{n}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}x^{n}\]

\end_inset 

 and substitutes this in to get the matrix form of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U\rho\right](x)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}b_{m}x^{m}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}x^{m}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}U_{mn}a_{n}\]

\end_inset 

 Equating each power of 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{m}$
\end_inset 

 we get 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\frac{1}{m!}\;\frac{d^{m}\left[U\rho\right](x)}{dx^{m}}\right|_{x=0}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}U_{mn}\left.\frac{1}{n!}\;\frac{d^{n}\rho(x)}{dx^{n}}\right|_{x=0}\]

\end_inset 

 as the matrix equation for the transformation of polynomials, expressed
 in classical notation.
 Completely equivalently, we can use the Dirac bra-ket notation, writing
 down the operator in space coordinates:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\left(g(x)-y\right)=U_{g}(x,y)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x|m\right\rangle \left\langle m|U_{g}|n\right\rangle \left\langle n|y\right\rangle \]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{mn}=\left\langle m|U|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x|m\right\rangle =x^{m}/m!$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n|y\right\rangle =\delta^{(n)}(y)/n!$
\end_inset 

, the latter being the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

'th derivative of the Dirac delta function.
 Then, integrating over 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

, we regain the previous expressions for the operator in Hilbert space:
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{multline*}
\left[U_{g}\rho\right](x)=\int dy\; U_{g}(x,y)\rho(y)\end{multline*}

 The above sets of expressions, although in a certain sense are 'equivalent',
 as we did use the equals sign, do in fact do a great deal of violence because
 they hide or incorrectly equate the function spaces on which the operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 acts.
 That is, whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset 

 is not differentiable or is otherwise singular, the expansion in derivatives
 is not justified; by contrast, 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 acting in the space of square-integrable functions may have non-differentiable
 eigenfunctions (which turn out to be, of course, fractals, which is the
 whole point of this excercise!) 
\layout Standard

If one is very lucky, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{mn}$
\end_inset 

 is upper-triangular, in which case it can be solved immediately for its
 eigenfunctions, and its eigenvalues already lie on the diagonal.
 We will find that we get lucky in this way for the Bernoulli operator,
 and for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 operator, but not for the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator.
 Of course, it is known that a complete solution of the GKW should lead
 directly to a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, so getting lucky would be
 truly lucky indeed.

The Frobenius-Perron Operator of the Bernoulli Map
\layout Standard

The Bernoulli map is an exactly solvable example of deterministic chaos.
 Its theory has been widely explored
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-2}

\end_inset 

, and we recap here only insofar as it gives a simple example of some of
 the more subtle upcoming issues.
\layout Standard

The Bernoulli map is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b(x)=2x-\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor \]

\end_inset 

 and can be thought of as poping the leading digit off of the binary expansion
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $x.$
\end_inset 

 This map has a positive Lyapunov exponent and is highly chaotic, as, in
 a certain sense, one can say that the digits of the binary expansion of
 some 'arbitrary' number are 'unpredicatable', and that the orbits of two
 close-by numbers will eventually become 'uncorellated' (after suitably
 defining what we mean by 'arbitrary' and 'unpredictable').
 
\layout Standard

The Frobenius-Perron operator of the Bernoulli map is given by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{B}f\right](x)=\frac{1}{2}\left[f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+f\left(\frac{x+1}{2}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset 

 Note that the the iterated tent map behaves sort-of like a shift state,
 in that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{B}\tau^{k}\right](x)=\tau^{k-1}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 although it does not terminate properly for a shift state: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{B}\tau\right](x)=\frac{1}{2}\]

\end_inset 

 (a true shift state would vanish on the final iteration).
 We see that the Takagi curve transforms as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{B}t_{w}\right](x)=1-\frac{w}{2}+wt_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 under the Bernoullli operator.
\layout Standard

Blah blah blah.
 How much more here do we want to say? Well, Provide the matrix elements.
 Provide the discrete eigenfunctions, which are amazingly also named after
 Bernoulli: the Bernoulli polynomials.
 What is the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{B}$
\end_inset 

? It is the set of functions that have odd symmetry.
 This implies that 'half' of all square-integrable functions are in the
 kernel.
 This is a huge space.
 The quotient space of the implied isomorphism thus has the Bernoulli polynomial
s as the representative elements.
 This is I think the correct way to relate coordinate space to the Hilbert
 space, is by means of the quotient space generated by the kernel of the
 time-evolution operator.
 This provides the isomorphisms, and any other square-integrable function
 is thus expandable as a linear combination of the polynomial eigenfunctions
 plus the kernel.
 Talk about 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset 

 and its spectrum.
 Symmetry symmetry talk about the symmetry group of the kernel.
 
\layout Standard

The continuous-spectrum eigenfunctions of the Bernoulli map are of course
 a generalizastion of the Takagi-Landsberg curve to complex values.
 These eigenfunctions are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\phi_{z,l}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^{n}\exp\left(2\pi i\;2^{n}\left(2l+1\right)x\right)\]

\end_inset 

 which have eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

: that is 
\begin_inset Formula $[U_{B}\phi_{z,l}](x)=z\phi_{z,l}(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 These are quite beautiful fractals (xxx provide a picture here).
 Symmetry is the name of the game here.
 
\layout Standard

These are protype forms for and the famous and beautiful Levy Dragons (reference
 the Paul Levy 1938 paper here) (actually Levy was trying to generalize
 the Koch curves).
 
\layout Standard

Note that when we go to look at the tesselatation of the hyperbolic plane
 by the hyperbolic triangle under the symmetry of the modular group, I think
 we get the tesselation of the plane with Levy's Dragons, which I think
 is the point that Paul Levy was trying to make.
 So this fits all ver nicely: we have a direct 1-1 correspondance between
 tesselations on the hyperplane with tessalations of real space by fractal
 curves.
 It is sufficient to talk about one to talk about the other.
\layout Standard

This also means that Bournoulli map also makes for a good toy example of
 quantum chaos.
 In quantum chaos, the eigenfunctions must form a complete set in the sense
 that for any given point in space, there must exist at least one eigenfunction
 that is non-vanishing on that point.
 In other words, the eigenfunctions of a quantum-chaotic system must tesselate
 the space in which they live.
 The toy example of this kind of tesselation is the Levy Dragon.

The Singular Sawtooth
\layout Standard

The frac function 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor $
\end_inset 

 is used in the construction of continued fractions.
 In this section, we will study a model for this function, where we replace
 the curve by a set of straight lines arranged between values of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/n$
\end_inset 

 for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 This forms a singular sawtooth, with a singularity at

This sawtooth function joins values of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/n$
\end_inset 

 with straight lines.
\end_inset 

 The Frobenius-Perron operator for this function is exactly solvable, and
 provides a toy model of the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator.
 The Frobenius-Perron operator of this sawtooth, acting on a general function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

, is given by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{w}f\right](x)=\sum_{x':w(x')=x}\frac{f(x')}{\left|dw(x')/dx'\right|}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}f\left(\frac{n+1-x}{n(n+1)}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 We will want to consider the action of this operator on polynomials of
 
\begin_inset Formula $y=1-x$
\end_inset 

, so that we can express 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

 as a Taylor's expansion about 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset 

.
 Lets make this change-of-variable now, and write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(y)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}y^{k}\equiv\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}y^{k}\]

\end_inset 

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{w}f\right](y)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}b_{k}y^{k}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}\left(\frac{n+y}{n(n+1)}\right)^{k}\]

\end_inset 

 Rarranging the sums, and equating terms with the same power of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

, we define the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{mk}$
\end_inset 

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b_{m}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}W_{mk}a_{k}\]

\end_inset 

 and find that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
W_{mk}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
m\end{array}\right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-m-1}(n+1)^{-k-1} & \;\textrm{ for \;} & k\geq m\\
0 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & k<m\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

 where we use 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
m\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset 

 to denote the binomial coefficient.
 This matrix is upper-triangular, and thus has its eigenvalues along the
 diagonal.
 These are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda_{k}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{k+1}(n+1)^{k+1}}\]

\end_inset 

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=1$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=2\zeta(2)-3$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the Riemann zeta.
 Numerically, we can see that the first few eigenvalues are 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=0.289868...$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=0.130396...$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{3}=0.0633278...$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{4}=0.031383...$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{5}=0.0156468...$
\end_inset 

 We can trivialy see that the ratio of eigenvalues settles down to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{k}/\lambda_{k+1}=2$
\end_inset 

 for large 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

, since the first term of the sum will dominate for large 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

We can solve the operator through recursion on the matrix elements of a
 related operator, by observing that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
Z_{mk}\equiv\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{m}(n+1)^{k}}\left[\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}\right]=Z_{m,k-1}-Z_{m-1,k}\]

\end_inset 

 These recurrance relations are bounded on the edges by 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{00}=1$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{01}=2-\zeta(2)$
\end_inset 

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
Z_{0k} &  & =Z_{0,k-1}-\left(\zeta(k+1)-1\right)=1-\sum_{j=1}^{k}\left[\zeta(j+1)-1\right]\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{10}=\zeta(2)-1$
\end_inset 

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
Z_{m0}=\zeta(m+1)-Z_{m-1,0}=(-)^{m}\left[1+\sum_{j=1}^{m}(-)^{j}\zeta(j+1)\right]\]

\end_inset 

 and we have 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{mk}=W_{mk}$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $m\leq k$
\end_inset

\end_inset 

 The Frobenius-Perron operator of this function provides a second model
 of the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator.
 It can be solved exactly; unfortunately, while one might think that there
 is a similarity transform to take it back to GKW, it turns out this similarity
 transform is dastardly singular, being just the Jacobian of the Minkowski
 question mark 
\begin_inset Formula $(?'\circ?^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset 

, which we'll examine shortly.
 The FP operator is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{C}f\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n}}f\left(\frac{2-x}{2^{n}}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 As before, we change variables to 
\begin_inset Formula $y=1-x$
\end_inset 

, expand both sides in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

, and match terms to find teh matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula \[
C_{mk}=\left(\begin{array}{c}

\end_inset 

 which is upper triangular (we take the binomial coeeficients to be vanishing
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $k<m$
\end_inset 

).
 The eigenvalues lie along the diagonal.
 The first few are 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=1$

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=1/3$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=1/7$

 with the ratio of successive eigenvalues tending to 2.

Under normal circumstances, whenever one has a pair of maps 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)$

\begin_inset Formula $\phi(x)$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)=(\phi\circ\beta\circ\phi^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset 

, then there exists a similarity transform 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}$
\end_inset 

 such that the Frobenius-Perron operators are also conjugate; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{\alpha}=S_{\phi}U_{\beta}S_{\phi}^{-1}$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}^{-1}=S_{\phi^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

.
 Formally, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}=1/(\phi'\circ\phi^{-1})$
\end_inset 

 where the prime denotes differentiation: 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi'(x)=d\phi(x)/dx$
\end_inset 

 .
 Since the continued-fraction shift function is conjugate to the sawtooth,
 one might hope that GKW would be conjugate to 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{C}$
\end_inset 

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{h}=S_{?}U_{C}S_{?}^{-1}$
\end_inset 

.
 Unfortunately, the similarity transform is highly singular, and would be
 very troublsome to work with.
 We deduce this because the similarity transform 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}$
\end_inset 

 normally preserves the eigenvalues; that is, the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{\alpha}$
\end_inset 

 equal those of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{\beta}$
\end_inset 

.
 In the current case, we see trouble in that the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{C}$
\end_inset 

 are not those of GKW.
 They are not even 'close', in that the ratio of tends to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{k}/\lambda_{k+1}=2$
\end_inset 

 whereas for the GKW the ratio is 2.65 (I'm not sure what this value is supposed
 to be; maybe its Khinchin's constant 2.685 or maybe Feigenbaum's constant
 (the ratio of period doubling 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=4.6692...$
\end_inset 

 which is 2+2.6692...).
 So which value is it, exactly?)

Other Trees of Rationals
\layout Standard

Recall that we were able to construct other trees that are isomorphic to
 the Stern-Brocot tree by passing the values in the Stern-Brocot Tree through
 a ratio of polynomials, thus mapping rationals to rationals.
 Monotonically-increasing functions will always perserve monotonicity of
 the question mark.
 Other mappings, such as the cubic 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{3}-x$
\end_inset 

, are in general not globally monotonic, but they are always locally monotonic.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $?((2x-1)^{3}-x+1)$
\end_inset 

 is montonic between the same regions that 
\begin_inset Formula $(2x-1)^{3}-x+1$
\end_inset 

 is, and thus it does not yeild a fundamentally new function.
 Thus, these ploynomial-based mappings of rationals into rationals do not
 generate another self-similar map, they are distorted versions of the Minkowski
 question mark.
\layout Standard

Here's a mapping that is continuous and is also fractally non-monotonic
 (and is thus self-similar): its 
\begin_inset Formula $x-?(x)$

Hilbert Lattice and Permuation Groups
\layout Standard

Note that continued fractions have a representation as a lattice in the
 infinitie-dimensional Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}^{\infty}=\mathbb{N\times N\times}...$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}=\mathbb{Z}^{+}$
\end_inset 

 the set of positive integers.
 Note that this implies that each point on this lattice can be given a unique
 value using the continued fraction mapping, and that each value appears
 only once on the lattice.
 In other words, the continued fraction brackets are an operator that maps
 this Hilbert space to the real numbers, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $[]:\mathbb{N}^{\infty}\mathbb{\rightarrow R}$
\end_inset 

.
 What makes the 
\begin_inset Formula $[]$
\end_inset 

 operator so interesting is that it is 1-1 and onto, and is thus invertible,
 at least on the irrationals, if we brush aside a little problem with the
 rationals.
 Note that in this mapping, the number 0 is a kind-of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

essential singularity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset 

, since the continued fraction expansion for 0 is 
\begin_inset Formula $0=[\infty,a_{2},a_{3},...]$
\end_inset 

 for arbitrary integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset 

.
 Indeed, all rationals suffer in this way: a finite contined fraction is
 just one where 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset 

 appears somewhere in the expansion, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N}]=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},\infty,a_{N+2},...]$
\end_inset 

.
 We can work around this difficulty by taking the kernel of [] and defining
 a quotient space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}^{\infty}/\ker[]$
\end_inset 

, and insisting that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $[]$
\end_inset 

 is 1-1 and onto in this quotient space.
 Homework: prove that this quotient space is validly defined and has the
 needed vector-space properties.
 In the subsequent discussion, we'll intentionally confuse 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}^{\infty}$
\end_inset 

 with this quotient space, wherever its convenient.
 In the following, we also make a convenient little confusion between the
 continued fraction map defined on the unit interval, and the map defined
 for non-negative reals: viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},...]\equiv a_{0}+[a_{1},a_{2},...]$
\end_inset 

 where we use the semicolon to distinguish this zero'th element.
\layout Standard

Note that this lattice is a subspace of the Hilbert space of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

generalized functions
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mu}:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $[]$

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ f\,|\, f:\mathbb{\mathbb{R}\rightarrow R}\right\} $
\end_inset

 The canonical example is  the Dirac delta oprator 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(x)$
\end_inset 

 which is zero everywhere, except at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$

 where it is infinite.

It seems intuitive that all other mappings from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}$

 that satisfy this invertability property are obtainable through the action
 of the permutation group, although one should always be careful with such
 statements..
 The permutation group elements are the shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor $
\end_inset 

 which acts as 
\begin_inset Formula $h:[a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},...]\mapsto[a_{2},a_{3},...]$
\end_inset 

 and the permuation operator 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{p,q}:[a_{1},...,a_{p},...,a_{q},...]\mapsto[a_{1},...,a_{q},...a_{p},...]$
\end_inset

 Homework: give the analytic form for 
\begin_inset Formula $S$

 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{p,q}(x)$

 This has a kernel that contains the group element 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{n}rg$
\end_inset 

 and so we ask about the group structure that results from this.

In particular, let us look at the family of analytic functions blah blah
 blah that is produced by invoking the permutation group on blah blah.
 What are the symmetries.

Conclusions
\layout Standard

Apologies for the format of this paper; its like the Picard Theorm suggests:
 this paper will touch on all possible topics an infinite number of times
 as it approaches the essential singularity of being completed.
\layout Standard

Blah Blah Blah, The modular group is the symmetry group of the hyperbolic
 plane, and trajectories on hyperbolic surfaces are known the have positive
 Lyapunov exponents, so once again, we have another curious tie into chaotic
 behvaiour.
\layout Standard

Note that this also means that all of the results from modular forms now
 have some sort of interpretation in the fractal world.
 The program is now how to map those results into statements about classical
 chaotic dynamics and more importantly, for quantum chaos.
 Do statements about Hamiltonian dynamics have corresponding statements
 in terms of modular forms? If so, what are they? What about the converse?

Open Questions
\layout Standard

Some unanswered questions of varing depth and complexity.
\layout Subsubsection

Multiplicity (Degeneracy) of Rationals
\layout Standard

If we enumerate the rationals 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

 for all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $p,q\in[1..N]$
\end_inset 

, there will be many duplicates after reducing by eliminating common factors.
 In the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $N\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset 

, what is the multiplicity (degeneracy) of any given rational? What is the
 group of symmetries of the resulting fractal?
\layout Subsubsection

Sagher Enumeration
\layout Standard

Sagher enumerates rationals m/n with the integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{2}n^{2}/q_{1}..q_{k}$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset 

 are the prime factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

.
 Make a graph of this distribution.
 
\layout Subsubsection

Simplicity
\layout Standard

The simplicity 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p/q)$
\end_inset 

of a farey number is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p/q)=1/pq$
\end_inset 

.
 The weighted simplicity is 
\begin_inset Formula $W(p/q)=w(p/q)2^{-N(p/q)-1}$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N(p/q)$
\end_inset 

 is the row number on the Farey Tree.
 Make a graph of this function.
 Relate it to the rest.
 Note that the sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p/q)$
\end_inset 

 on one row of the farey sums to 1, and that thus, the sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $W(p/q)$
\end_inset 

over all rationals equals 1.
 See Cut the Know for the correct attribution for this concept.

The Gauss-Kuz'min Wirsing Distribution
\layout Standard

The Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing (GKW) distribution gives likelyhood of the occurance
 of any given partial sum in a continued fraction expansion.
 If we were instead to flatten that distribution, and work backwards, this
 would imply the existance of a measure/distribution on the rationals.
 What is that distribution? If we were to replace the GKW distribution by
 some arbitrary (monotonically-creasing, continuous) mapping, what would
 eb corresponding measure be that is induced? Can we analyse the these measures
 in terms of the eigenfunctions of the GKW? 
\layout Subsubsection

Algebraic Pellian-like Equations
\layout Standard

Given arbitrary real 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y$
\end_inset 

, one can find a sequence of rationals that converge on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 and whose gaps converge on 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

.
 Can this sequence be expressed as approximants to some algebraic equation,
 somewhat in analogy to the Pellian equations? What would that series of
 equations be?
