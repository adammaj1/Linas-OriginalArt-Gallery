\layout Abstract

Fractals and Continued Fractions seem to be deeply related in many ways.
 Farey numbers appear naturally in both; chaotic systems behave in a fashion
 reminiscent of the Riemann Zeta.
 This paper attempts to illustrate some these relationships and possibly
 advance some tools that may make the study and classification of fractals
 easier.
