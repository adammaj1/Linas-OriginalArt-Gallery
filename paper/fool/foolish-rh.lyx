\begin_layout Title
A Foolish Proof of RH
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
What's wrong with this picture? Is there some glib handwaving masking the
 failing part of the proof?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wherein we provide the overall review of what is to come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Musings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Outline form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Finite summations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The divisor operator 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{D}$
\end_inset

 and the mobius operator 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{D}$
\end_inset

, written in matrix form, are clearly inverses of one another.
 All summations are finite, the operators are upper-triangular by construction,
 all summations are textbook material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Non-Singularity of the operators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because they are invertible, we conclude that they are not singular.
 But in what space? Answer: in 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Certainly in the space of finite-length (bounded-length) vectors.
 How about infinite-length vectors?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Proof: suppose there exists an arithmetic function aka vector 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\{a_{n}\}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{D}a=0$
\end_inset

 But we really do have 
\begin_inset Formula $M=L^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and so the diagonal elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $ML$
\end_inset

 really are all ones.
 which we can prove by finite means.
 So there are no such 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 The space in question is simply the set of all bounded sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{\infty}=\left\{ \{a_{n}\}:\left|a_{n}\right|<\infty\right\} $
\end_inset

 i.e.
 elements can be any finite number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Careful: for the proof above, it was sufficient to assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in l_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 because, by assumption, we started with 
\begin_inset Formula $La=0$
\end_inset

 and so there were from the get-go no issues about summability.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 itself is not defined on 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 , since, just looking at the very first row, which are all-ones, its clear
 that this will be absolutely summable if and only if we pick 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in l_{1}$
\end_inset

 where as always, 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}=\left\{ \{a_{n}\}:\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|<\infty\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 So both 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 amd 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 are absolutely defined on 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 They're also defined for conditionally convergent sums.
 But we have a proof about the kernel that holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 and certainly its the case that conditionally convergent series are a subset
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{\infty}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the next step, we are interested in conditionally convergent sums that
 are in 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{2}=\left\{ \{a_{n}\}:\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|^{2}<\infty\right\} $
\end_inset

 because this is where Fourier series are.
 Everyone knows that of course 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}\subset l_{2}\subset l_{\infty}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Summability class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, observe that neither 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 nor 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 change the summability class.
 This follows from the fact that the matrix elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 are always +1, 0 or -1 and from the fact that they are upper-triangular.
 What do we mean by this statement? And where do we apply it? We claim that,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in l_{1}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}L_{mn}a_{n}\right|<\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|L_{mn}a_{n}\right|\le\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|L_{mn}\right|\le1$
\end_inset

 and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|M_{mn}\right|\le1$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, we have the identity 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|L_{mn}a_{n}\right|^{2}\le\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 and the analogous one for 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, although these do not seem to be needed just yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Analytic sums and analytic continuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wherein we establish that the formal algebraic identity 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{-s}\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}L_{mn}n^{-s}$
\end_inset

 and its mate, 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{-s}/\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}M_{mn}n^{-s}$
\end_inset

, obtained by purely algebraic means, also hold as analytic summations on
 the entire complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

-plane.
 These require analytic continuation, in a purely classical sense, to work
 around the obvious poles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Absolute convergence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, take a step back.
 We start by observing that 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{-s}\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}L_{mn}n^{-s}$
\end_inset

.
 This holds as a purely formal, algebraic manipulation.
 Clearly, it also holds as a numerical summation, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>1$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, it cannot possibly hold for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1n}=1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-1}=\infty$
\end_inset

 by which we mean the sum diverges.
 No surprise here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s)$
\end_inset

 has a pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset

.
 This pole will dog the rest of the arguments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Analytic continuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, treated as a conditionally-convergent sum, we claim that numerical
 identity holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{-s}\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}L_{mn}n^{-s}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Can this really hold true? What is meant by this? Well, let's do this row
 by row.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$
\end_inset

, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}L_{1n}n^{-s}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-s}$
\end_inset

 which is just the standard definition.
 We can do the standard manipulations of analytic continuation to define
 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s)$
\end_inset

 for the entirecomplex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

-plane, as long as we avoid the pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset

.
 Nothing exciting happens here, because 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1n}=1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 How about 
\begin_inset Formula $m=2$
\end_inset

? Here, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2n}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 odd and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2n}=1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 even.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}L_{2n}n^{-s}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(2n)^{-s}=2^{-s}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n{}^{-s}=2^{-s}\zeta(s)$
\end_inset

.
 There do not seem to be any dubious manipulations here, either.
 The summation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(2n)^{-s}$
\end_inset

 has an obvious pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset

, but it can be analalytically continued past it.
 Thus, by the usual rules of analytic continuation, pulling out the factor
 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-s}$
\end_inset

 out of the summation is a valid and justified operation.
 The same argument obviously repeats for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=3,4,5,\cdots$
\end_inset

 and so we conclude that the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{-s}\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}L_{mn}n^{-s}$
\end_inset

 must hold on the entire complex plane, for any 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 Well, we have not demonstrated that the strength of the pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset

 is the same on the right and left hand sides of the equation, but this
 seems both immaterial, and not challenging to prove.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Mobius
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By similar arguments to the above, we claim that likewise, the equation
 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{-s}/\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}M_{mn}n^{-s}$
\end_inset

 holds for all 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and on the entire complex plane 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 The important ingredients here are that, for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$
\end_inset

, the summation is again classically known, and that, for 
\begin_inset Formula $m>1$
\end_inset

 we have, as before, just a Hilbert hotel with interspersed empty rooms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, there are far more poles to maneuver around, thus making practical
 calculation far more difficult.
 However, there's no question that the classic number theory sums involving
 the Mobius function are somehow suspect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fourier series
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wherein we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x;s)$
\end_inset

 and show that it is well-behaved, in all of the usual textbook senses.
 That is, we define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta(x;s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-s}\exp\left(2\pi inx\right)
\]

\end_inset

and show that its analytically plausible on the entire complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

-plane.
 This is again, classical stuff, covered in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Apo90,Apo76"

\end_inset

Apostol (xx which one?), for example.
 However, despite its seemingly innocuous written form, do not underestimate
 the complexity of the above: it has essential singularities on the complex
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-plane, and not one but multiple branch cuts.
 It is closely related to the polylogarithm, and a complete development
 is given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Ve-Poly07"

\end_inset

.
 At any rate, it is well-behaved for real 
\begin_inset Formula $0<x<1$
\end_inset

, and we shall not need it for any other values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other problem here is to understand the formally derived equations 
\begin_inset Formula $L\beta(x;s)=\zeta(s)\beta(x;s)$
\end_inset

 and the corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $M\beta(x;s)=\zeta(s)^{-1}\beta(x;s)$
\end_inset

, and quite exactly what they really imply in terms of summability and analytici
ty.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fourier series, definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now add the Fourier bits back in.
 We write 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}\exp\left(2\pi ixn\right)$
\end_inset

.
 If we demand absolute convergence, then 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 For Fourier series, we only demand 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, we are willing to accept sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in l_{2}$
\end_inset

 if we want 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)$
\end_inset

 to be well-defined.
 Again, this is all standard textbook material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Integrability, 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{p}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{(p)}$
\end_inset

 spaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But let's review it anyway.
 In order for Fourier series to work, we have to have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in L^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{(2)}=\left\{ f:\int_{0}^{1}\left|f(x)\right|^{2}dx<\infty\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Claim that 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in l_{2}$
\end_inset

 is sufficient to guarantee that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in L^{(2)}$
\end_inset

.
 Need to find citation for this.
 This is really a special case of a well-known result from Banach spaces
 that relates 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{p}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{(q)}$
\end_inset

 for blah blah.
 Need citation for this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above does NOT mean that the summation holds for all 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 It is very much NOT the case that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\alpha(x)\right|<\infty$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{(\infty)}\subset L^{(2)}\subset L^{(1)}$
\end_inset

.
 But that's OK, because we don't need 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{(\infty)}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The beta function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For what values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x;s)$
\end_inset

 well-defined? Well, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x;s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-s}\exp\left(2\pi inx\right)$
\end_inset

 its clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is absolutely summable iff 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>1$
\end_inset

and that it is conditionally summable iff 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Basically, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is well-behaved in this area, in the classic textbook sense of well-behaved.
 That is, for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\beta(x;s)\right|=\left|\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-s}\exp\left(2\pi inx\right)\right|<\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|n^{-s}\exp\left(2\pi inx\right)\right|=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-\Re s}
\]

\end_inset

and so that we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\in L^{(\infty)}$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>1$
\end_inset

.
 But this just follows from a well-known correllary of the theory of Lesbesgue
 spaces.
 Which we already cited up above.
 And, again, we observe that the series 
\begin_inset Formula $\{n^{-s}\}\in l_{2}$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We can also write this in dullardly detail:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|n^{-s}\exp\left(2\pi inx\right)\right|^{2}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-2\Re s}<\infty
\]

\end_inset

when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, lets just claim that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x;s)$
\end_inset

 is analytic on the entire complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

-plane, except for the obvious pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset

.
 This can be acheived because 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x;s)$
\end_inset

 is bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s)$
\end_inset

.
 That is, consider any analytic continuation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s)$
\end_inset

 into any region 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 of the complex plane, to give an absolutely convergent summation 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{R}(s)$
\end_inset

 on that region.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x;s)$
\end_inset

 can be continued in the same way, giving an absolutely convergent series
 representation 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{R}(x;s)$
\end_inset

 having the property that ..
 err.
 well.
 that its bounded.
 It ain't got no pole surprises in store for us.
 It ain't got not pole but the one at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Eigen-Equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We already know, by purely formal means, that 
\begin_inset Formula $L\beta(x;s)=\zeta(s)\beta(x;s)$
\end_inset

.
 For what values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is this well defined? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We claim that 
\begin_inset Formula $L\beta(x;s)=\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\exp\left(2\pi imx\right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}L_{mn}n^{-s}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The critical strip
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Suppose that there exists a zero 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\sigma+i\tau$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma>\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $L\beta(x;s)=0$
\end_inset

.
 So, lets multiply this by 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 What happens? Well, first of all, this is not the same L and M as before.
 What are these new beasts, and how are they related to the old beasts?
 In particular, in what sense can we expect 
\begin_inset Formula $M=L^{-1}$
\end_inset

 to still hold in this new setting?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
todo: prove claim: if 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 is ..
 what ..
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

?? then show that 
\begin_inset Formula $Lf(x)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 also.
 Similarly, for 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset
