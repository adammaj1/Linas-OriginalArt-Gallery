Associating Meaning to Form:
Pairing Link Grammar Disjuncts to WordNet Senses

Abstract:
This paper provides a breif report on an experiment pairing WordNet
senses[ref] to the atomic syntactical forms used by the Link Grammar
theory of parsing[ref]. The basic insight is the observation that,
sometimes, one can determine which sense is intended, of several senses
that a word
may have, simply by seeing how it is used in a sentence. Thus, for
example, while the word "suffer" has many meanings, when it is used
in the sentence: "She suffered a fracture in the accident", its meaning 
is (more or less) unambiguosly narrowed down to one, the one sense that most
readers would agree on.  At the same time, the word "suffer" can be used
in a wide variety of syntactic constructions: most grammars provide a
list of rules under which the word "suffer" can be used in a
grammatically correct way in a sentence; Link Grammar has hundreds of
such rules (or "disjuncts") for this word alone.  

Can specific meanings be associated with narrow grammatical usages?
A rough pairing of form and content has been obvious for centuries: 
the set of possible meanings of a word is narrowed down by assigning
to it a part-of-speech. Insofar as Link Grammar disjuncts resemble
very fine-grained part-of-speech markup, the goal of this paper is
to further narrow down the possible meanings of a word by localizing
them to particular grammatical usages. And vice-versa: given a
particular gramatical usage, can its meaning be induced?


Introduction

A core idea of linguistics is that structure carries meaning

The Link Grammar perser, when parsing this
sentence, uses a particular rule, or disjunct

fine-grained part-of-speech

construction grammar
