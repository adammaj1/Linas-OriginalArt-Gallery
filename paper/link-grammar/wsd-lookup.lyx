\begin_layout Abstract
Word-sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms are fairly CPU-intensive, requiring
 many seconds or even minutes to run on modern hardware, making WSD impractical
 in a web-services setting.
 This paper presents results for performing word-sense assignments based
 on a table lookup of syntactic parser output.
 Table lookup is extremely fast, and parsing can be reasonably fast, thus
 providing practical, fast WSD.
 The table was previously constructed by correlating parse structures with
 word-sense selection using traditonal WSD algorithms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Specifically, the CMU Link Grammer parser is used.
 The output of this parser tags individual words with the syntactic form
 of how the word was used in a sentence.
 This tag can be thought of as a very fine-grained part-of-speech tag, making
 syntactic distinctions much finer than the usual noun/verb/adj/adv distinctions.
 These fine-grained tags are shown to correlate reasonably well with word
 senses.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That there is a correlation between English-language syntax, and word senses,
 is obvious, and underlies the presentation of dictionaries: word senses
 are grouped according to part-of-speech (POS): noun, verb, adjective, adverb.
 Parts of speech are crude indicators of the allowed syntactic use of a
 word: so, in general, one cannot use a noun in place of a verb.
 There are exceptions: English grammar does allow the use of nouns as noun
 modifiers, the verbing of nouns by means of gerunds, and one can, to a
 limited extent, verbize one's nouns directly.
 But each of these grammatical operations alters the sense of a word as
 well as changing is POS category.
 Some dictionaries attempt a more fine-grained distinction of word senses:
 thus, for example, the xxx dictionary frequently uses section headings
 of 
\emph on
v.tr.

\emph default
 and 
\emph on
v.intr.

\emph default
 to denote word senses that are used only with the transitive or intranstive
 form of a verb.
 Thus, upon witnessing a verb used in a certain sentence in a certain way,
 one can immediately narrow down the possible senses for that verb.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is is natural to presume that the correlation between word senses and
 word usage might continue to a finer, more detailed level, if only one
 had a finer, more detailed dictionary, and could make finer, more detailed
 syntactic observations.
 This is the primary thesis of this paper.
 To illustrate this, consider, for example, the verb 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to suffer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The xx dictionary lists nn senses for this; other dictionaryes list mm
 to nn senses.
 The Princeton WordNet dictionary lists xx meanings.
 Now consider the sentence:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\emph on
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She suffered a fracture.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Constructing such detailed dictionaries by hand is not practical, and so
 one must find an automated technique.
 Similarly, one does not perform syntactic analysis by hand; one uses existing
 natural-langugae (NLP) parsers.

what about results by POS category?? e.g.
 does this work better for verbs, or for nouns? wahat about adj/adv?
