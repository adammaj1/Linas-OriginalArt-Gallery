\begin_layout Abstract
The age-old observation that sense and syntax are correlated is used to
 build a table-driven word-sense disambiguation algorithm.
 Because the sense is determined by a table lookup, it is extremely fast,
 making it suitable for practical, real-time semantic-web applications.
 By contrast, existing word-sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms are fairly
 CPU-intensive, requiring many seconds or even minutes to run on modern
 hardware.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The lookup table is constructed by correlating natural language parse structures
 with word-sense assignments.
 The key observation is that certain parse structures resemble very fine-grained
 part-of-speech (POS) tags, and that this fine-grained tag can be used to
 construct a more fine-grained (but otherwise traditional) word-sense dictionary.
 Manually creating such a dictionary is overwhelming, and so the dictionary
 is constructed using automated techniques: a large body of text is tagged
 with senses using a standard WSD algorithm, and then tabulated with the
 result of NLP parses of the same text.
 The POS distinctions are much finer than the usual noun/verb/adj/adv distinctio
ns or even the Penn Treebank POS tags.
 These fine-grained tags allow the correlation between sense and syntax
 to be examined at a more detailed level than usual.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That there is a correlation between English-language syntax, and word senses,
 is obvious, and underlies the presentation of dictionaries: word senses
 are traditionally grouped according to part-of-speech (POS): noun, verb,
 adjective, adverb.
 Parts of speech are crude indicators of the allowed syntactic use of a
 word: so, in general, one cannot use a noun in place of a verb.
 Of course, there are exceptions: English grammar does allow the use of
 nouns as noun modifiers, the verbing of nouns by use of gerunds, and one
 can, to a limited extent, verbize one's nouns directly.
 But each of these grammatical operations alters the sense of a word as
 well as changing its POS category; the word sense is no longer the same,
 and most dictionaries supply distinct entries for each usage: senses and
 POS tags correlate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some dictionaries attempt a more fine-grained distinction of word senses:
 thus, for example, The American HeritageÂ® Dictionary of the English Language
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AmHeritage2000"

\end_inset

 frequently uses section headings of 
\emph on
v.tr.

\emph default
 and 
\emph on
v.intr.

\emph default
 to denote word senses that are used only with the transitive or intranstive
 form of a verb.
 Thus, upon witnessing a verb used in a certain sentence in a certain way,
 one can immediately narrow down the possible senses for that verb.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is is natural to presume that the correlation between word senses and
 word usage might continue to a finer, more detailed level, if only one
 could make finer, more detailed syntactic observations, and had a finer,
 more detailed dictionary to work with.
 This is the primary thesis of this paper: such finer distinctions are possible
 and useful.
 To illustrate this, consider, for example, the verb 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
to suffer
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The American Heritage Dictionary lists seven senses for this; other dictionarie
s list from 5 to 11 senses.
 The Princeton WordNet dictionary[xxxref] lists 11 meanings.
 Now consider the sentence:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\emph on
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She suffered a fracture in the accident.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A syntactic analysis shows that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
suffer
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is in the past tense, takes a singular pronomial subject, a singular direct
 object, and a modifying prepositional phrase.
 The corresponding WordNet sense key is 
\emph on
suffer%2:29:01::, (undergo (as of injuries and illnesses))
\emph default
.
 This example is syntactically quite different than those of other example
 sentences taken from WordNet:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\emph on
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This author really suffers in translation.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the verb is in the present tense, has a singular subject, a prepositional
 modifier, but no object: it corresponds to sense 
\emph on
suffer%2:30:02::, (be set at a disadvantage)
\emph default
.
 Similarly one has
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\emph on
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

Many saints suffered martyrdom.
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which has a plural subject, is in past tense, and the object is an uncountable
 (mass) noun: this corresponds to the sense 
\emph on
suffer%2:39:01::, (undergo or be subjected to)
\emph default
.
 Each of these example sentences, taken from WordNet itself, shows a strong
 correlation between the syntactic structure of the sentence, and the designated
 word sense.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of this correlation can be erased by altering the example sentences,
 and creating new, grammatically correct sentences, by altering the tense,
 the count of the subject or object, the presence or absence of the object,
 or adding/removing a modifying perpositional phrase.
 But do native English speakers generate all possible sentence constructions
 with equal probability? Clearly not: idioms, the strict coupling of a few
 words, are a well-known liguistic phenomenon.
 This observation can be taken much farther: the Mel'cuk Meaning-Text Theory[xxx
] posits that the intended meaning of an expression strongly influences
 the structure of the sentence that expresses that meaning; conversely,
 that certain sentence patterns are used only with limited, well-defined
 subsets of nouns, verbs.
 Thus, the proper study of the correlation between sense and syntax, in
 order to be valid and correct, must become an exercise in corpus linguistics:
 the tabulation of the frequency of word usage as used by actual writers,
 as compared to the intended sense of the author.
 To the extent that such a correlation exists, it can be tabulated into
 a dictionary, and this dictionary can, in turn, be used to quickly guess
 at the intended meaning, given only the syntactic usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discovering this correlation relies on large-scale computational linguistics
 techniques.
 Although one might be able to analyze, by hand, a few verbs or nouns, in
 the manner illustrated above, this is hardly practical to get a true sense
 of the prevelance of this correlation.
 In doing a small-scale analysis, one might discover only a few words that
 appear to be highly correlated, without being able to say much about the
 language, in general.
 Thus, the approach used here is to parse a large quantity of text, obtaining
 syntactic structure, and to tag the same text with word-senses, and so
 as to generate statistics correlating the two tag sets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

weak link
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to this automated approach is sense tagging.
 The quantity of text hand-tagged by experts with word senses is not large
 enough to usefule for collecting a reasonable amount of statistics; thus
 sense-tagging must be performed automatically.
 Although automated sense tagging or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

word sense disambiguation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (WSD) algorithms have been improving, the best simple, straight-forward
 systems remain marginal in precision and recall.
 This raises an interesting question: is it possible that, by correlating
 sense tags with syntactic usage, that the incorrect tags will statistically
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cancel out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, while correct tags will reinforce? That is, is it possible that a lookup-table
 based WSD algorithm might have euqal or better accuracy than the underlying
 WSD system from which it was constructed? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For parsing, the Link Grammar parser [xxx ref] is used.
 The output of the Link Grammar parser are

linkages
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

disjuncts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that explicitly express how a word is connected to its vicinity.
 It's output is essentially a series of statements such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this is a verb with a singular subject on the left, a singular direct object
 on the right, and a modifying prepositional phrase
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, expressed in a compact notation (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Ss- Os+ MVp+
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for this example).
 Word-sense tagging was performed using an implementation of the Mihalcea
 all-words word-sense disambiguation algorithm [xx need ref].
 This algorithm is reasonably accurate and straightforward to implement.
