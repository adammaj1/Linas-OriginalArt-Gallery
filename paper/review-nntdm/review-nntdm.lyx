Review date: 5 July 2021
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Review summary: A central lemma that the ressult depends on is incorrect.
 Fixing the lemma gives a different kind of result, one that is interesting
 and peculiar in it's own right.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Lemma 2.2 is incorrect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lemma is not right.
 I will provide to simple demonstrations of this, and a variant that is
 perhaps desirable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Direct substitution in Lemma 2.2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way of quickly checking results is to try direct subsitution.
 The lemma claims
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{k^{4m}+n^{2}k^{4m-2}}\quad{?\atop =}\quad\frac{1}{2}\sum_{s=1}^{2m-1}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{s+1}}{k^{4m-2s}n^{2s}}
\]

\end_inset

If this is to hold for all 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 then it must hold for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$
\end_inset

.
 By direct substitution, one gets
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{k^{4}+n^{2}k^{2}}\quad{?\atop =}\quad\frac{1}{2}\sum_{s=1}^{1}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{s+1}}{k^{4-2s}n^{2s}}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{k^{2}n^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

which is clearly false.
 Attempting 
\begin_inset Formula $m=2$
\end_inset

 shows that it won't work there, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Factorization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A different way of seeing the result is to factorize terms more carefully.
 That is, write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{k^{4m}}\cdot\frac{1}{1+n^{2}k^{-2}}=\frac{1}{k^{4m}+n^{2}k^{4m-2}}\quad{?\atop =}\quad\frac{1}{2}\sum_{s=1}^{2m-1}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{s+1}}{k^{4m-2s}n^{2s}}=\frac{1}{2k^{4m}}\sum_{s=1}^{2m-1}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{s+1}}{k^{-2s}n^{2s}}
\]

\end_inset

dropping the leading factor on both sides, one gets
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{1+n^{2}k^{-2}}\quad{?\atop =}\quad\frac{1}{2}\sum_{s=1}^{2m-1}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{s+1}}{k^{-2s}n^{2s}}
\]

\end_inset

The left hand side does not involve 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 in any way.
 The right hand side does â€“ it is a sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 terms.
 None of these terms are zero, and the leading terms are always identical;
 therefor this cannot possibly be right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Desired result
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below follows a simple derivation of what perhaps might have been hoped
 for.
 Consider the expansion
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{1-x}=\sum_{p=0}^{\infty}x^{p}
\]

\end_inset

This holds for all real 
\begin_inset Formula $-1<x<1$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $x=-k^{2}/n^{2}$
\end_inset

 and requiring that 
\begin_inset Formula $k<n$
\end_inset

, one gets
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{1+k^{2}/n^{2}}=\frac{n^{2}}{n^{2}+k^{2}}=\sum_{p=0}^{\infty}\left(-1\right)^{p}\frac{k^{2p}}{n^{2p}}
\]

\end_inset

Multiplying both sides by 
\begin_inset Formula $1/n^{2}k^{4m-2}$
\end_inset

 gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{k^{4m}+n^{2}k^{4m-2}}=\sum_{p=0}^{\infty}\left(-1\right)^{p}\frac{1}{k^{4m-2-2p}n^{2p+2}}
\]

\end_inset

Here, the left hand side is that of Lemma 2.2.
 The right hand side is clearly something different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this holds only for 
\begin_inset Formula $k<n$
\end_inset

.
 It is not a well-conditioned sum otherwise, as, for 
\begin_inset Formula $k>n$
\end_inset

, each term is becomes progressively larger.
 To btain a convergent sum, one can play some games with analytic continuation,
 but that is outside of the scope of the current effforts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Main theorem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sadly, this ruins the main theorem.
 The expansion for the hyperbolic cotangent (Lemma 2.1) appears to be correct;
 I verified this, but did not double-check.
 Unfortunately, the revised identity holds only for 
\begin_inset Formula $k<n$
\end_inset

 and therefore cannot be plugged in directly.
 Despite this, it can sometimes be useful to play some games, and treat
 the problem as a formal series, hoping that a re-arrangement of terms by
 the end can rescue the situation.
 So lets try this.
 Started from the hyperbolic cotangent,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\coth\pi k}{k^{4m-1}}= & \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{4m}}+2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{4m-2}n^{2}+k^{4m}}\right)\\
= & \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\zeta\left(4m\right)+2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{4m-2}}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{2}+n^{2}}\right)\\
= & \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\zeta\left(4m\right)+2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{4m-2}}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}}\sum_{p=0}^{\infty}\left(-1\right)^{p}\frac{k^{2p}}{n^{2p}}\right)\\
= & \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\zeta\left(4m\right)+2\sum_{p=0}^{\infty}\left(-1\right)^{p}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{4m-2-2p}}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2p+2}}\right)\\
= & \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\zeta\left(4m\right)+2\sum_{p=0}^{\infty}\left(-1\right)^{p}\zeta\left(4m-2-2p\right)\zeta\left(2p+2\right)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Well, this is certainly a peculiar kind of beast.
 The middle bits rrequired working with a sum that is only formally defined,
 but cannot converge numerically, because the 
\begin_inset Formula $k<n$
\end_inset

 condition is violated.
 Despite this, the final sum does appear to be convergent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To bring it closer to the form that Plouffe and Ramanujan provide, the hyperboli
c cotangent should be substituted:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\coth\pi k}{k^{4m-1}}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{2\pi k}+1}{k^{4m-1}\left(e^{2\pi k}-1\right)}
\]

\end_inset

So, this is similar, but curiously different.
 It lacks the rapid convergence properties, which is what Plouffe was interested
 in: Plouffe has some arbitrary-precision software, and so he can (easily)
 evaluate these sums to thousands of digits.
 In this way, he was able to discover the indicated identites numerically,
 but he had no algebraic, formal proof that they held.
 As it happened, a variant of them, in a non-obvious form, can be found
 in Ramanujan's diaries (without proof).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above form lacks the rapid convergence poroperties, because of the factor
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{2\pi k}$
\end_inset

 in the numerator.
 The infinite sum over the double zeta is also numerically discouraging.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the fact that this shows up as a kind of hidden or cryptic Fourier
 transform is notable.
 A revised paper with the above corrections seems publishable, I guess.
 Explicitly strengthening and tying together that this is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

secret
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hidden
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Fourier transform can certainly make things more interesting.
 It seems worthwhile to make this as explicit as possible.
