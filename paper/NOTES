if AB=1 but BA !=1 then write 1-BA = DL+LD
if above is possible, then this hints at a chain map or homotopy.
Explore/explain.

-------------------------
Write p_k = exp (-E_k) / sum_i exp (-E_i) is a probability
Now, exp is a map of tangent to geodesics, so what is the above?
The minus sign is confusing, what's up with that?

Similarly but with an i in above, i.e. Feynmann action path integral.

--------------------------
entropy is S = -sum_k p_k ln p_k  but if p_k is an elt of a geodesic, then
what is the entropy?  And what is the free energy F = S - TE  ??
