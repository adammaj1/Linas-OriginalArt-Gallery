if AB=1 but BA !=1 then write 1-BA = DL+LD
if above is possible, then this implies a chain map or homotopy.

Is the completion of the Thompson group (i.e. by allowing infinite
products) is that the Thompson group, or is it something else?

-------------------------
Write p_k = exp (-E_k) / sum_i exp (-E_i) is a probability
Now, exp is a map of tangent to geodesics, so what is the above?
The minus sign is confusing, what's up with that?

Similarly but with an i in above, i.e. Feynmann action path integral.

--------------------------
entropy is S = -sum_k p_k ln p_k  but if p_k is an elt of a geodesic, then
what is the entropy?  And what is the free energy F = S - TE  ??

--------------------------
standard model issues (as of 2016):

* anamolous proton radius as measured by muonic hydrogen

* fifth force -- excited nuclei of beryllium-8, if a new particle
  existed with a mass of approximately 17 million electron volts

  Someone writes:
  "What about the Hungarian group?  the group has also published
  two previous papers in which comparable anomalies were observed,
  including a possible particle with a mass of 12 million electron
  volts and a second publication claiming the discovery of a particle
  with a mass of about 14 million electron volts. Both of these
  claims were subsequently falsified by other experiments."

* muon g-2 measurements don't match the standard model.
  remeasure at fermilab with luminosity 20x of brookhaven

* old stuff: CKM mixing angles
