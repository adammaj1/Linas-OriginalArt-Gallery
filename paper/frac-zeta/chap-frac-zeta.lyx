\layout Abstract

The Takagi curve is a simple, exactly solvable fractal curve exhibiting
 the symmetry of the Modular Group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

.
 By constructing a similar curve using a Dirichlet Series instead of the
 MacLaurin series, one gets a visually similar curve which obeys a more
 complex set of self-similarities.
 These can be expressed as a set of relations on the Riemann Zeta and Hurwitz
 Zeta.
 
\layout Abstract

This paper assumes familiarity with the development of the symmetries of
 the Takagi Curve and the Minkowski Question Mark exhibited in companion
 papers.
 In other respects, the presentation is kept as simple as possible, avoiding
 appeals to abstract mathematical concepts as much as possible.
\layout Abstract

This paper is part of a set of chapters that explore the relationship between
 the real numbers, the modular group, and fractals.

, which is what we'll do and find.
\layout Subsection

The Analog of the Takagi Curve as a Dirichlet Series
\layout Standard

We saw in an earlier chapter how to build the Takagi Curve as a MacLaurin
 sum over the Tent Map, and how this curve transformed under the three-dimension
al representation of the Modular Group.
 One can consider other series built out of the Tent Map, and ask what thier
 transformation properties are.
 In this section, lets consider the Dirichlet series.
 These are related to the Takagi Curve through analytic transformations.
 Thus, we define 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta_{s}(x)\equiv\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\tau^{n}(x)\; n^{-s}\label{eq:zeta-s}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the tent map as defined before:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
2(x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor ) & \textrm{\; for \;} & 0\leq x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor <1/2\\
2-2(x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor ) & \textrm{\; for \;} & 1>x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor \geq1/2\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

 By substituting 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
n^{-s}=\frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_{0}^{\infty}y^{s-1}e^{-ny}dy\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 and performing the sum, and making the change-of-variable 
\begin_inset Formula $w=e^{-y}$
\end_inset 

 one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta_{s}(x)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_{0}^{1}\left(-\ln w\right)^{s-1}t_{w}(x)dw\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the Takagi Curve as defined in previous sections.
 Note that a pole in 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(x)$
\end_inset 

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $w=1$
\end_inset 

 translates into a pole (with the same residue) at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Graphically, a picture of this Dirichlet series looks very similar to the
 Takagi curve itself, possibly looking a tad 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

noisier
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

; thus, figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:The-Takagi-Landsberg-Curve}

\end_inset 

 suffices to visualize this curve.
 XXX redo.
 Although visually similar, and thus 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

obviously
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 self-similar, the transformation properties of this curve are far, far
 messier.
 We get 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
(\zeta_{s}\circ g_{D})(x)=\zeta_{s}(\frac{x}{2})=x+\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s+k-1\\
s-1\end{array}\right)\left(-\right)^{k}\zeta_{s+k}(x)\label{eq:zeta-g}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 for the simplest relation.
 This can be derived by using the identity 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(\frac{n}{n+1}\right)^{s}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s+k-1\\
s-1\end{array}\right)\left(\frac{-1}{n}\right)^{k}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 in the expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{s}(x/2)$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

Comparing equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:zeta-g}

\end_inset 

  to the equivalent expression for the Takagi Curve, we see that the transformat
ion law mixes curves with different order parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 Comparing this equation to the expression for the matrix elements for the
 Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing (GKW) Operator developed in earlier chapters, (xxx
 give ref) we see that this is essentially a summation over the columns
 of the GKW.
 Essentially, what we would like to be able to say is that if we could work
 with the diagonal form of the GKW, then we would get a curve that transforms
 under the simple 3D representation of the modular group, just as the Takagi
 Curve does.
 We develop idea this a bit further in a later section.
 
\layout Standard

We can make an explict connection the the Riemann Zeta by considering specific
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(1/3)=2/3(1-w)$
\end_inset 

 and so we get 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta_{s}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)=\frac{2}{3}\zeta(s)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s)$
\end_inset 

 is the Riemann Zeta.
 Similarly, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{s}(1/6)=(2\zeta(s)-1)/3$
\end_inset 

.
 Using this with equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:zeta-g}

\end_inset 

 we find the following relation: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=1+\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s+k-1\\
s-1\end{array}\right)\left(-\right)^{k}\zeta(s+k)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This sum is conditionally convergent, thus we prefer to make the analytic
 continuation 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s+k)=\zeta(s+k)-1+1$
\end_inset 

 and perform the sum explicitly to get 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=1+2^{-s}+\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s+k-1\\
s-1\end{array}\right)\left(-\right)^{k}\left[\zeta(s+k)-1\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Although not strictly necessary for the above, we can repeat the analytic
 continuation trick to get 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=1+2^{-s}+3^{-s}+\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s+k-1\\
s-1\end{array}\right)\left(-\right)^{k}\left[\zeta(s+k)-1-2^{-(s+k)}\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 or in general, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=H_{m+1}(s)+\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s+k-1\\
s-1\end{array}\right)\left(-\right)^{k}\left[\zeta(s+k)-H_{m}(s+k)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where we used 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{m}(s)$
\end_inset 

 to stand for the harmonic number 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{m}(s)=\sum_{k=1}^{m}k^{-s}$
\end_inset 

 and we require that 
\begin_inset Formula $m\geq1$
\end_inset 

 for the summation over zetas to be convergent.
 
\layout Standard

This equation is interesting because, in a certain sense, it encapsulates
 the action of the generator 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 of the Modular Group on the Riemann Zeta.
 The equation itself is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

new
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, it can also be obtained using entirely classical methods: for example,
 starting with Abramowitz & Stegun equation 6.4.9, the classical series expansion
 for the polygamma function.
 What is novel is that it seems to show a certain funny type of fractal
 self-similarity in the Riemann Zeta.
 We can recursively apply this relation to find additional relations.
 The generator 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{n}$
\end_inset 

 is associated with 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=H_{m+n}(s)+\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s+k-1\\
s-1\end{array}\right)\left(-n\right)^{k}\left[\zeta(s+k)-H_{m}(s+k)\right]\label{eq: general n,m}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where, for convergence of the right hand side, we should take 
\begin_inset Formula $m\geq n$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Subsection

The Relation for p/q = 1/2
\layout Standard

We would like to extend these relations to all group elements of the form
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}}$
\end_inset 

.
 This is easier said than done.
 The curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{s}(x)$
\end_inset 

 is even across 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset 

 just like the Takagi Curve is, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $(r_{S}\zeta_{s})(x)=(\zeta_{s}\circ r_{D})(x)=\zeta_{s}(x)$
\end_inset 

 and so we expect  the polynomial parts of the transformation law to be
 identical to those for the Takagi curve.
 Thus, we can write the representation as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g_{S}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0\\
0 & 1 & G\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and \;}r_{S}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
1 & -1\; & 0\\
0 & 0 & I\end{array}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which acts on the vector
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
x\\
\zeta_{s}(x)\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 just as in the Takagi representation.
 The difference is that here, 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset 

 is understood to be the operator that mixes together different orders:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
(G\zeta_{s})(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s+k-1\\
s-1\end{array}\right)\left(-\right)^{k}\zeta_{s+k}(x)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Just to be crystal clear, we can now write equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:zeta-g}

\end_inset 

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
(g_{S}\zeta_{s})(x)=(\zeta_{s}\circ g_{D})(x)=x+(G\zeta_{s})(x)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 and then use matrix concatentation to construct general elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 just as in the Takagi case.
 
\layout Standard

This result remains abstract until we plug in specific values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 to get back relations on the Riemann Zeta.
 This is where the true adventure begins.
 We could try, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $x=(grg)(1/3)=5/12$
\end_inset 

 but this can lead to some confusion.
 To unclutter the issue, pick 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/5$
\end_inset 

 and ignore connections to 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 for a moment.
 We then have 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(1/5)=2/5$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{2}(1/5)=4/5$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{3}(1/5)=2/5$
\end_inset 

 and so we see that after one step, the iteration immediately settles down
 to an orbit of period 2.
 We then have 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\zeta_{s}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) & = & \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\tau^{n}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)\; n^{-s}\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{2}{5}\left(1+\frac{1}{3^{s}}+\frac{1}{5^{s}}+...\right)+\frac{4}{5}\left(\frac{1}{2^{s}}+\frac{1}{4^{s}}+...\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{2}{5}\left(1-2^{-s}\right)\zeta(s)+\frac{4}{5}2^{-s}\zeta(s)\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{2}{5}\zeta(s)\left(1+\frac{1}{2^{s}}\right)\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

 Inserting this into equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:zeta-g}

\end_inset 

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{s}}\right)=1+\frac{1}{2^{s}}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s+k-1\\
s-1\end{array}\right)\left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^{k}\zeta(s+k)\label{eq:one-half}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 What happens if we pick an 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 giving an orbit of period three? For instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/7$
\end_inset 

 has an orbit (2/7, 4/7, 6/7).
 Unfortunately, this gives rise to a sum that is not directly solvable,
 as one prominently must wrestle with the series 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
1+\frac{1}{4^{s}}+\frac{1}{7^{s}}+\frac{1}{10^{s}}+...\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which doesn't seem to be quickly or easily expressibe in terms of the Riemann
 Zeta.
 It can however, be expressed as the Hurwitz Zeta, as can sums involving
 orbits with higher periods.
 We come back to these in a later section; for now we will pursue a more
 direct route.
\layout Subsection

Relations for Half-Integer Values
\layout Standard

We can consider equations 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq: general n,m}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:one-half}

\end_inset 

 to be the generators of a free semigroup of symmetries on the Riemann Zeta.
 It thus becomes interesting to ask what some of the generated expressions
 look like; this section presents some of these.
 
\layout Standard

We can simplify the presentation by developing a shorthand for the recurring
 elements in the sums.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
Z_{m}(s,x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(-\right)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s+k-1\\
s-1\end{array}\right)\left[\zeta(s+k)-H_{m}(s+k)\right]x^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 For fixed, real 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 this is a monotonically decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

.
 In this notation, we can re-write equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:one-half}

\end_inset 

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{s}}\right)=1+\frac{1}{2^{s}}Z_{0}\left(s,\frac{1}{2}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Iteration on this then gives the series 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\zeta(s)\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{s}}\right) & = & 1+\frac{1}{3^{s}}+\frac{1}{4^{s}}\left[Z_{0}\left(s,\frac{1}{4}\right)+Z_{0}\left(s,\frac{3}{4}\right)\right]\nonumber \\
 & = & 1+\frac{1}{3^{s}}+\frac{1}{5^{s}}+\frac{1}{7^{s}}+\nonumber \\
 &  & \;\;\;+\frac{1}{8^{s}}\left[Z_{0}\left(s,\frac{1}{8}\right)+Z_{0}\left(s,\frac{3}{8}\right)+Z_{0}\left(s,\frac{5}{8}\right)+Z_{0}\left(s,\frac{7}{8}\right)\right]\nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{k=0}^{2^{m-1}-1}\frac{1}{\left(2k+1\right)^{s}}+\frac{1}{2^{m}}Z_{0}\left(s,\frac{2k+1}{2^{m}}\right)\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

 There does not seem to be any simple way to further simplify the above
 expression, and, in particular, to obtain an expression involving only
 (for example) 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{0}(s,1/4)$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

Iterating on equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq: general n,m}

\end_inset 

 gives correspondign equations for general half-integer and dyadic values.
 Turning the crank once gives a relation for general half-integer values:
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{s}}\right)=H_{2m+2n+1}(s)-\frac{H_{n+m}(s)}{2^{s}}+\frac{1}{2^{s}}Z_{m}\left(s,n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\label{eq: n and half}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This can be better understood by noting that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H_{2m+2n+1}(s)-\frac{H_{n+m}(s)}{2^{s}}=\sum_{k=0}^{m+n}\frac{1}{\left(2k+1\right)^{s}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 and of course that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{s}}\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\left(2k+1\right)^{s}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 and so we see that we have a general resemblance between equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq: general n,m}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq: n and half}

\end_inset 

.
 As before, we pick a value for 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset 

 large enough to make sure that the right hand side of equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq: n and half}

\end_inset 

 remains convergent (
\begin_inset Formula $m>n$
\end_inset 

 is enough), and it reappears on the left-hand side in a corresponding fashion.
 Turning the crank a second time produces 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(s)\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{s}}\right)=H_{4m+2n+3}(s)-\frac{H_{2m+n+1}(s)}{2^{s}}+\frac{1}{4^{s}}\left[Z_{m}\left(s,\frac{2n+1}{4}\right)+Z_{m}\left(s,\frac{2n+3}{4}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset 

 with additional turns generating more relations in this series.
