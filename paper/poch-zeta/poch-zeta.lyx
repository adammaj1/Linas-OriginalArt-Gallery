\layout Abstract

A series representation for the Riemann Zeta function in terms of the falling
 Pochhammer symbol is derived from the polynomial representation of the
 Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing (GKW) operator.
 
\layout Section

Introduction
\layout Standard

The Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator [ref] occurs in the theory of continued
 fraction representations of the real numbers.
 The zeroth eigenvalue of this operator is related to the Gauss-Kuzmin distribut
ion [ref], giving the likelyhood of the occurance of an integer in the continued
-fraction expansion of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

arbitrary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 real number.
 The GKW operator is interesting in other ways, notably in its relationship
 to the Minkowski Question Mark function, and thus its symmetry under the
 action of a monoid sub-semi-group of the Modular group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

.
 Except for the zeroth eigenvector, there is no known closed-form solution
 of the GKW operator, although the eigenvalues may be computed relatively
 easily through standard matrix diagonalization techniques.
\layout Standard

In this paper, a relationship to the Riemann Zeta function is noted, allowing
 the easy derivation of a series expansion of the Zeta function in terms
 of the Pochhammer symbols (the falling factorials), or equivalently the
 binomial coefficients.
 Specifically, the expansion that is given is
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-s\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-)^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s-1\\
n\end{array}\right)t_{n}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

Here, the constants 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset 

 play a role analogous to the Stieltjes constants, and can be given in a
 simple, finite-term closed form, involving the Riemann zeta function at
 integer values and the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
 These constants are related to the Stieltjes constants as a sum involving
 the Stirling numbers.
 They are very well behaved, becoming small quite rapidly.
 Some exact expressions can be derived for various sums involving these
 constants.
 A numerical exploration of thier values is also performed.
 
\layout Standard

The first section defines the GKWoperator in simple terms.
 The second section obtains the series expansion for the zeta.
 The third section explores the values of the constants 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$

The Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing Operator
\layout Standard

Succesive terms of a continued fraction fraction expansion for a real number
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 may be obtained by iterating on the function 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
h(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor \label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This iterated map is sometimes called the Gauss map.
 It is connected to the Riemann zeta function by a Mellin transform:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=\frac{1}{s-1}-s\int_{0}^{1}h(x)\, x^{s-1}dx\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

In the theory of iterated functions [ref], the behaviour of a map may be
 studied by means of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

transfer operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, sometimes called the Frobenius-Perron operator of a map.
 Given a map of the unit interval onto itself, the transfer operator describes
 how a smooth, differentiable distribution behaves under the action of the
 map, thus giving insight into the nature of iteration.
 By using a set of orthonormal basis functions on the unit interval, such
 as orthogonal polynomials, the matrix elements of the transfer operator
 can often be explicitly computed, and the operator itself can be diagonalized,
 using standard techniques from the theory of Hilbert spaces and functional
 analysis in general.
 
\layout Standard

There are a variety of equivalent definitions for the transfer operator,
 of varying degrees of sophistication.
 One simple definition is 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[U\rho\right](x)=\int dy\;\delta\left(x-h(y)\right)\;\rho(y)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset 

 is the function being iterated, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset 

 is some density on which the transfer operator 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

 acts.
 In this expression, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset 

 is understood to be the Dirac delta function.
 A more sophisticated definition is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
xxx\]

\end_inset 

 For the Gauss map, the transfer operator is known as the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing
 (GKW) operator, and has the representation 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[U_{h}\rho\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{2}}\rho\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 It is not difficult perform this operation under the integral defining
 the Riemann zeta function in terms of the gauss map; effectively the operation
 is a change of variable.
 One obtains the operator equation
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-s\int_{0}^{1}dx\; x\left[U_{h}x^{s-1}\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This equation motivates a deeper study to the GKW operator, as its symmetry
 properties under the monoid under the modular group may provide insight
 into the behavior of the Riemann zeta, and, for example, the Riemann Hypothesis
 (RH).
 In particular, the above form allows the RH to be expressed as a vector
 equation, given below.
 
\layout Standard

The GKW operator has one well-known eigenvector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)=1/(1+x)$
\end_inset 

, which corresponds to the unit eigenvalue.
 A closed form for the other eigenvectors is not known.
 The author has attempted a computer-guided search for a closed-form solution
 in terms of a simple linear combination, with rational coefficients, of
 common special functions, including the factorial, the gamma and the digamma
 functions.
 o solution was found.

Assorted Algebraic Identities
\layout Standard

The action of the GKW operator can be computed explicitly for a variety
 of simple functions.
 This section lists an assortment of random algebraic results, none particularly
 deep, although many are suggestive in various ways.
 These are listed here mostly for the sake of completeness.
 
\layout Standard

First, we notice that adjacent terms in the series can be made to cancel
 by shifting the series by one:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[U_{h}f\right](x)-\left[U_{h}f\right](x+1)=\frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}}f\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which holds for any function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x).$
\end_inset 

 Thus, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset 

 is an eigenvector, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{h}\rho=\lambda\rho$
\end_inset 

, then it would also solve 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}}\rho\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right)=\lambda\left(\rho(x)-\rho(x+1)\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

This can be solved easily to get the zeroth eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\rho_{0}(x)=\frac{1}{\ln2}\;\frac{1}{1+x}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $[U_{h}\rho_{0}](x)=\rho_{0}(x)$
\end_inset 

 and the normalization is given by requiring 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{1}\rho_{0}(x)\, dx=1\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 We can see one hint of the relationship between period-doubling and the
 GKW in the identity 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{1}{1+x}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{2^{n}}\left[\frac{2}{x+n}-\frac{1}{x+n+1}\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A reflection identity: 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=1-(1+x)^{-2}$
\end_inset 

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{h}f=1-f$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

Another: 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{h}[(1+?(x))/(1+x)^{2}]=1-?(x)$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the Minkowski Question Mark function.
\layout Standard

Another: 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{h}[?(x)\, x^{-2}]=2-?(x)$
\end_inset 

 .
 One can construct a variety of identities of this sort, for example: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U_{h}\left[?(x)\left(\frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}}-2\right)\right]=\frac{?(x)-2}{(1+x)^{2}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 but these types of exercises do not seem to lead to any sort of worthwhile
 recurrence relations.
 
\layout Standard

Acting on the monomial, one gets 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[U_{h}x^{k}\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{(n+x)^{k+2}}=\frac{(-)^{k+2}}{(k+1)!}\psi^{(k+1)}(1+x)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{(k)}(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the polygamma function, the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

'th derivative of the Gamma function.
 The true difficulty of finding the solution to GKW becomes clear when the
 search leads one to start discovering complicated identities, such as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{m^{2}}\psi^{(1)}\left(1+\frac{1}{m}+x\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{(n+x)^{2}}\psi^{(1)}\left(\frac{1}{n+x}+1\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 or curiosities such as 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=(1+ax)^{2}$
\end_inset 

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{h}f=\psi^{(1)}(1+x+a)$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

For 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=(1+nx)^{-2}-1$
\end_inset 

 one gets 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{h}f=-\sum_{k=1}^{n}(x+k)^{-2}$
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Acting on a general power, the map gives the Hurwitz Zeta: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[U_{h}x^{s}\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{(n+x)^{s+2}}=\zeta(s+2,x+1)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 and this transformation gives us another hint of a deep relationship to
 the Bernoulli Map.
 The Hurwitz zeta function can be analytically continued to the entire complex
 plane; one may choose to take this as the defnition of the GKW operator
 acting on negative values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 In particular, for negative integer values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, one concludes that the operator gives the Bernoulli polynomials.
\layout Section

Polynomial Representation
\layout Standard

The obvious avenue of attack is to look for an analytic solution to the
 GKW operator, and thus to consider representations of the operator in a
 polynomial basis.
 A natural first choice is to consider a representation in terms of the
 monomials 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{n}$
\end_inset 

 or equivalently, a Taylor expansion about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset 

.
 This proves to be an unfortunate choice, as will be shown.
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{h}f=g$
\end_inset 

 and substituting a Taylor's expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

, one finds 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{g^{(m)}(0)}{m!}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\,(-)^{m}\;\frac{(k+m+1)!}{m!\,(k+1)!}\,\zeta(k+m+2)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 The operator matrix elements can be immediately read off to be 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[U_{h}\right]_{mk}=(-1)^{m}\;\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\zeta(k+m+2)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where the factorials are replaced by the binomial coefficient that they
 form.
 Unfortunately, this is a poorly conditioned matrix, with a rapidly increasing
 matrix elements and a trace that does not converge.
 Progress may be made by applying a regulator and using Levin-type sequence
 acceleration techniques[ref].
 This leads to a number of curious identities, some of which were listed
 previously.
 However, the difficulty of working with divergent sums seems to outweigh
 any advantages given by the relatively simple form of the matrix elements.
 
\layout Standard

Presuming that there is some sort of singularity at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset 

, one may try expansions at different locations.
 Thus, consider 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f^{(n)}(a)\,(x-a)^{n}/n!$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset 

 likewise expanded about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=b$
\end_inset 

.
 With this expansion, the operator relation 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{h}f=g$
\end_inset 

 becomes 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{g^{(m)}(b)}{m!}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}U_{mn}^{(b,a)}\;\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Without much difficulty, one discovers that the matrix elements are given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U_{mn}^{(b,a)}=(-1)^{m}\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-a)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\zeta_{H}(k+m+2,1+b)\label{eq:general elts}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{H}(s,q)$
\end_inset 

 is the Hurwitz zeta function:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta_{H}(s,q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+q)^{s}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b=1/2$
\end_inset 

, one obtains the well-known expansion of xxx [ref], which is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U_{mn}^{(1/2,1/2)}=(-1)^{m}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^{n-k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\left[2^{m+k+2}\left(\zeta(k+m+2)-1\right)-\zeta(k+m+2)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 
\layout Standard

A simpler expression is obtained by expanding about 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b=1$
\end_inset 

, and the matrix is rather well-conditioned and easier to work with.
 It is: 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
G_{mn}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\left[\zeta(k+m+2)-1\right]\label{eq:GKW-matrix-elts}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which satisfies
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
(-)^{m}\frac{g^{(m)}(1)}{m!}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}G_{mn}(-)^{n}\frac{f^{(n)}(1)}{n!}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 The above will be the most convenient for expressing the Riemann zeta,
 as will be done in the next section.
 
\layout Standard

All of these expressions for the matrix elements for the GKW operator have
 a common form.
 It contsists of two summations: the outer summation, and the summation
 defining the Hurwitz zeta function.
 Pulling out this second summation, one finds terms consisting of a series
 of polynomials, which are most simply expresssed in terms of Gauss' hypergeomet
ric series: 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Gamma_{mn}(x)\equiv(m+1)\,_{2}F_{1}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\begin{array}{cc}
-n\; & \; m+2\end{array}\\
2\end{array}\;;\; x\right]=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)(-x)^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 These have a curious superficial resemblance to the shifted Legendre polynomial
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\widetilde{P}_{n}(x)\equiv\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+n\\
n\end{array}\right)(-x)^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

Switching the order of summation in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:general elts}

\end_inset 

 gives the following: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U_{mn}^{(b,a)}=(-1)^{m+n}a^{n}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(j+1+b)^{m+2}}\,_{2}F_{1}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\begin{array}{cc}
-n\; & \; m+2\end{array}\\
2\end{array}\;;\;\frac{-1}{a(j+1+b)}\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This has the general form of a zeta polynomial series, namely, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum\]

\end_inset 


\layout Section

The Riemann Zeta and Stieltjes Constants
\layout Standard

Inserting this into the integral expression for the Riemann Zeta gives 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-s\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{G_{mn}(-)^{n}}{(m+1)(m+2)}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s-1\\
n\end{array}\right)\label{eq:zeta-as-gkw}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This expression may be considerably simplified, and this is developed in
 the next section.
 
\layout Standard

Some of the multiple sums appearing in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:zeta-as-gkw}

\end_inset 

 may be performed explicitly.
 Using 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset 

to denote the intermediate sum, one may write
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-s\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-)^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s-1\\
n\end{array}\right)t_{n}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 It is not to difficult to verify that the 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset 

take the form
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
t_{n} & = & \sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{G_{mn}}{(m+1)(m+2)}\nonumber \\
 & = & 1-\gamma+\sum_{k=1}^{n}(-)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left[\frac{1}{k}-\frac{\zeta(k+1)}{k+1}\right]\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0.577...$
\end_inset 

 is the Euler-Mascheroni Constant.
 For large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}\rightarrow1/2(n+1)$
\end_inset 

, motivating the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
a_{n}=t_{n}-\frac{1}{2(n+1)}\label{eq: a_n defn}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 so that the Riemann zeta may be written as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-\frac{1}{2}-s\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-)^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s-1\\
n\end{array}\right)a_{n}\label{eq:zeta-as-a_n}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 If we write the binomial coefficient as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\begin{array}{c}
s-1\\
n\end{array}\right)=(s-1)_{n}/n!$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $(x)_{n}$
\end_inset 

 is the falling Pochhammer symbol, we see that the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 play the analogue of the Stieltjes constants for this kind of Umbral, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

divided differences
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 type equation.
 Unlike the Stieltjes constants, the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 have a simple, finite expression.
 For example, the first few may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
a_{0} & = & \frac{1}{2}-\gamma\label{eq:}\\
a_{1} & = & \frac{\zeta(2)}{2}-\gamma-\frac{1}{4}\\
a_{2} & = & \zeta(2)-\frac{\zeta(3)+2}{3}-\gamma\\
a_{3} & = & \frac{3}{2}\zeta(2)-\zeta(3)+\frac{\zeta(4)}{4}-\frac{23}{24}-\gamma\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

 and so on.
 Numiercally, the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are small, and seem to be bounded and oscillatory.
 A detailed numerical analysis of these values is given in the enxt section.
\layout Standard

The 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

appear naturally in the Taylor's expansion for the Gamma function, and so
 one finds, with little difficulty, that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\alpha(z) & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}z^{n}\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{1}{1-z}+\frac{\ln(1-z)}{z}\left(\frac{1}{1-z}-\frac{1}{2}\right)+\frac{1}{z}\ln\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{1-z}\right)\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

 The above may be obtained by the straightforward application of equation
 6.1.33 from Abramowitz and Stegun [ref].
 This is an interesting function in its own right.
 At first glance, one might think that its divergent at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

, with a cut extending to the right for 
\begin_inset Formula $1<z$
\end_inset 

.
 In the cut one might guess that there are poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $-n=1/(1-z)$
\end_inset 

, that is, at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1+1/n$
\end_inset 

, accumulating to an essential singularity at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
 But this doesn't seem to be the case at all; some preliminary analysis
 seems to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(z)$
\end_inset 

 is an entire function, and doesn't have any poles or singularities anywhere.
 This function deserves a more thorough investigation.
 Some curious values for this sum are 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}=\ln\sqrt{2\pi}-1=-0.081061467...\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which can be obtained from Sterling's formula, and 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}2^{-n}=2-3\ln2=-0.079441542...\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Its equally curious that other variations on the expression given in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:zeta-as-a_n}

\end_inset 

 are even more trivial, namely, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-)^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s-1\\
n\end{array}\right)x^{n}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-)^{n}(s-1)_{n}\,\frac{x^{n}}{n!}=\left(1-x\right)^{s-1}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $(s)_{n}=s(s-1)(s-2)...(s-n+1)$
\end_inset 

 is the falling factorial.
 One is left to wonder what the function 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mu(s;x)=\frac{s}{s-1}-\frac{1}{2}-s\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-)^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s-1\\
n\end{array}\right)a_{n}x^{n}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 might be like; it is presumably related to the Polylogarithm (Jonquiere's
 function) XXXX Do the scratching needed to get the relationship nailed
 down.
 Ugh.
 The general idea of replacing power series by series in rising or falling
 Pochhammer symbols and then exploring the curious relationships that result
 is referred to as Umbral Calculus; it seems that a number of interesting
 relationships can be obtained in this way.

Numerical Analysis
\layout Standard

The equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq: a_n defn}

\end_inset 

 is very conducive to numerical analysis.
 The vaues of the zeta function for small integers are known to millions
 of digits; Plouffe has given a series of very rapidly converging sums for
 the larger integers.
 Thus, it becomes possible to explore the behvaiour of the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 up to 
\begin_inset Formula $n\sim500$
\end_inset 

 with only a moderate investment in coding and computer time.
 Note, however, that in order to get up to these ranges, computations must
 be performed keeping hundreds of decimal places of precision, due to the
 very large values that the binomial coefficient can take.
 In teh following, caluclations were performed using the GNU Multi-Precision
 Library [ref].

The author attempted a numeric fit to the oscillatory behvaiour of the function.
 An excellent fit for the 
\begin_inset Formula $k'th$
\end_inset 

 zero is provided by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
q(k)=1.970+\frac{17\pi}{16}k+\frac{\pi}{4}k^{2}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which appears to fit the zero-corssings to better than a few parts per
 thousand, at least for the larger values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

.
 Note that the value 17/16 is not meant to imply that this value is truly
 exact; numerically, the value 2.125 seems to be the ideal fit, and it is
 written here as 17/16 in order to be suggestive.
 This equation is trivially invertable to give the oscillatory behaviour
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

; it is given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
s_{n}=\sin\pi\left(\frac{-1}{16}+\sqrt{\frac{289}{256}+4\,\frac{(n-1.97)}{\pi}}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

This figure shows a graph of

.
 It is essentially a graph of the log of the amplitude of the oscillations
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 Note the absence of any 'blips' that would occur if the sinusoidal fit
 to the data was poor; the sinusoidal curve 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}$
\end_inset 

 models the data remarkably well.
 This figure also illustrates a fit to the amplitude.
 Specifically, the fit curve is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $3+3.6\sqrt{n+1}$
\end_inset 

.
 Note that this fit fails badly for values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n\lesssim20$
\end_inset 

 and that for larger 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, the fit is only good to 
\begin_inset Formula $3+3.6\sqrt{n+1}+\log(a_{n}/s_{n})\simeq0\pm0.5$
\end_inset 

 on average.
 
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Asymptotically, the amplitude of the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 appears to be given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
a_{n}\simeq s_{n}\exp-\left(3+3.6\sqrt{n+1}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 However, a more precise fit is strangely difficult.
 An attempt to numerically fit the data with an expression of the form 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
a_{n}\simeq s_{n}\exp-\left(b+\left(c+dn\right)^{\epsilon}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 results in fit parameters of 
\begin_inset Formula $b=3.9\pm1.5$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c=-50\pm100$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d=12.87\pm0.15$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0.5\pm0.007$
\end_inset 

.
 This fit is not very pleasing; in particular, the true asymptotic behaviour
 doesn't seem to set in until 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 is larger than several hundred, which is unexpectedly high.

A Related Function
\layout Standard

The 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

may be further explored by generalizing them to be a function on the complex
 plane, instead of an integer.
 One such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and reasonable generalization is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
a(s)=1-\gamma-\frac{1}{2(s+1)}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(-)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s\\
k\end{array}\right)\left[\frac{1}{k}-\frac{\zeta(k+1)}{k+1}\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 By construction, this function interpolates the previous series, so that
 
\begin_inset Formula $a(n)=a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 for non-negative integers 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

.
 This function has a pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=-1$
\end_inset 

, and this series expansion is convrgent only for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>-1$
\end_inset 

.

 The ribbing on the left and upper-left is entirely due to numerical errors,
 as the sums converge only with great difficulty.
 The color scheme is such that black corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $-\pi$
\end_inset

 Thus, the red-to-black color discontinuities, correspond to a phase change
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$

 Note that these terminate on zeros or poles; in this case, it appears that
 there is only one pole, at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=-1$

 In particular, it appears that all of the zeros occur on the real number
 line.

Relation to the Stieltjes constants
\layout Standard

The 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are can be used to express the Stieltjes constants and vice-versa by re-express
ing the binomial coefficient with a power series, making use of Stirling
 Numbers.
 That is, we write 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
s-1\\
n\end{array}\right)=\frac{(s-1)_{n}}{n!}=\frac{1}{n!}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left[\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right](s-1)^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset 

 is the Stirling Number of the First Kind.
 Substituting in the above, and comparing to the standard definition of
 the Stieltjes constants 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=\frac{1}{s-1}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-)^{n}}{n!}\gamma_{n}(s-1)^{n}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{0}=1/2-a_{0}=\gamma$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\gamma_{k}=-ka_{k-1}+(-)^{k}k!\,\sum_{n=k}^{\infty}(-)^{n}\frac{a_{n}}{n!}\left(\left[\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k-1\end{array}\right]\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Note that the Stirling Numbers can be written as a sum over a product of
 harmonic numbers.
 That is,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right]=(-)^{k-n}\frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!}w(n,k-1)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $w(n,0)=1$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
w(n,k)=\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\frac{\Gamma(1-k+m)}{\Gamma(1-k)}H_{n-1}^{(m+1)}w(n,k-1-m)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 and the Harmonic numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{n}^{(m)}$
\end_inset 

 are given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H_{n}^{(m)}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k^{m}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This finally allows us to write 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\gamma_{k}=-ka_{k}+k\sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{n}\left(w(n,k-1)-(k-1)w(n,k-2)\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

and so the factorial factors cancel, leaving only the sum over the crazy
 product of harmonics.
 XXX todo show some of the values of w, esp.
 along the diagonal.

Conclusions
\layout Standard

In the above, we stumbled over an expansion for the Riemann Zeta in terms
 of the falling factorial.
 The falling factorial is a polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and takes part in many interesting identities that suggest further exploration.
 In fact, the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $(s-1)_{n}$
\end_inset 

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $(s-1)^{n}$
\end_inset 

 both fall into a class of functions with share many common properties with
 respect to differentiation, exponentiation, translation and the like, and
 are known as Sheffer Sequences.
 Thus, we suggest that it  could also be interesting to explore the Zeta
 constructed out of Sheffer sequences, that is, to find the 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{n}$
\end_inset 

 in an expansion
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-s\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-)^{n}w_{n}p_{n}(s-1)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where the polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(x)$
\end_inset 

 form a Sheffer sequence.
 This undertaking is interesting because there may be one particular Sheffer
 sequence for which the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Generalized Stieltjes Constants
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{n}$
\end_inset 

 take on a particularly simple or interesting form.
 This is already suggested by the above, where the expression of the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 presented above is considerably simpler than most presentations of the
 traditional Stieltjes constants.
 Such work might be made doubly interesting by the fact the theory of Sheffer
 sequences often shows up in the theory of lattice paths and tilings, whereas
 the representation of the real numbers as p-adics or rationals is essentially
 a kind of lattice representation (having a modular group symmetry).
