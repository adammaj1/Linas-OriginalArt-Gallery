\layout Abstract

This paper presents a certain peculiar generalization of the Riemann hypothesis,
 as the action of the permutation group on the elements of continued fractions.
 The problem is difficult to attack through traditional analytic techniques,
 and thus this paper focuses on providing a numerical survey.

This paper is part of a set of chapters that explore the relationship between
 the real numbers, the modular group, and fractals.

Intro
\layout Standard

THIS IS A DRAFT WORK IN PROGRESS.
 The intro hasn't been written yet, but if it was, it might say this:
\layout Standard

The Riemann zeta can be expressed as an integral in the following form:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-s\int_{0}^{1}h(x)x^{s-1}dx\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
h(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor \label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 is sometimes called the Gauss map: it lops of a digit in the continued
 fraction expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

.
 That is, if we write the continued fraction expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $x=[a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},...]$
\end_inset 

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)=[a_{2},a_{3},...]$
\end_inset 

.
 It is a reverse shift operator on the continued fraction expansion.
 The study of continued fractions is interesting because of the close proximity
 of a number of problems of fractals and dynamical systems, including Farey
 fractions and modular group symmetries.
 More immediately, the transfer operator of the Gauss map is known as the
 Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator, which has a number of intereswting properties
 of its own.
\layout Standard

In this paper, we note that the Gauss map can also be thought of as one
 particular element of the permuation group acting on a Hilbert space representa
tion of the real numbers.
 Thus, we are lead to contemplate other elements of the permutation group.
 Specifically, considerthe permuation operator 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{p,q}:[a_{1},...,a_{p},...,a_{q},...]\mapsto[a_{1},...,a_{q},...a_{p},...]$
\end_inset 

 which exchanges the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

'th and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

'th digits of the continued fraction expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{p,q}$
\end_inset 

 maps the unit interval onto the unit interval, and is discontinuous at
 a countably infintite number of points.
 We present graphs below visualizing 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{p,q}(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 The generalized Riemann hypothesis that we choose to explore concerns the
 zeros of the integral 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta_{p,q}(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-s\int_{0}^{1}S_{p,q}(x)x^{s-1}dx\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Although this integral can in principle be evaluated analytically, the
 result is a messy set of nested sums that don't seem to be easily summable,
 nor provide any particular insight.
 Thus, we instead choose to explore this integral numerically.
 More precisly, we consider the sum which arises from treating the integral
 as a very simple Newtonian sum with equally spaced abscissas:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta_{N;p,q}(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-\frac{s}{N}\;\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}S_{p,q}\left(\frac{2n+1}{2N}\right)\;\left(\frac{2n+1}{2N}\right)^{s-1}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Hilbert Lattice and Permuation Groups
\layout Standard

Note that continued fractions have a representation as a lattice in the
 infinitie-dimensional Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}^{\infty}=\mathbb{N\times N\times}...$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}=\mathbb{Z}^{+}$
\end_inset 

 the set of positive integers.
 Note that this implies that each point on this lattice can be given a unique
 value using the continued fraction mapping, and that each value appears
 only once on the lattice.
 In other words, the continued fraction brackets are an operator that maps
 this Hilbert space to the real numbers, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $[]:\mathbb{N}^{\infty}\mathbb{\rightarrow R}$
\end_inset 

.
 What makes the 
\begin_inset Formula $[]$
\end_inset 

 operator so interesting is that it is 1-1 and onto, and is thus invertible,
 at least on the irrationals, if we brush aside a little problem with the
 rationals.
 Note that in this mapping, the number 0 is a kind-of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

essential singularity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset 

, since the continued fraction expansion for 0 is 
\begin_inset Formula $0=[\infty,a_{2},a_{3},...]$
\end_inset 

 for arbitrary integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset 

.
 Indeed, all rationals suffer in this way: a finite contined fraction is
 just one where 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset 

 appears somewhere in the expansion, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N}]=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},\infty,a_{N+2},...]$
\end_inset 

.
 We can work around this difficulty by taking the kernel of [] and defining
 a quotient space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}^{\infty}/\ker[]$
\end_inset 

, and insisting that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $[]$
\end_inset 

 is 1-1 and onto in this quotient space.
 Homework: prove that this quotient space is validly defined and has the
 needed vector-space properties.
 In the subsequent discussion, we'll intentionally confuse 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}^{\infty}$
\end_inset 

 with this quotient space, wherever its convenient.
 In the following, we also make a convenient little confusion between the
 continued fraction map defined on the unit interval, and the map defined
 for non-negative reals: viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},...]\equiv a_{0}+[a_{1},a_{2},...]$
\end_inset 

 where we use the semicolon to distinguish this zero'th element.
\layout Standard

Note that this lattice is a subspace of the Hilbert space of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

generalized functions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, in that any map 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathbb{N}^{\infty}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 induces a map 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mu}:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

, through the isomorphic operator 
\begin_inset Formula $[]$
\end_inset 

.
 The normal definition of a generalized function is that its a map 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{f}:\mathcal{F}\mathbb{\rightarrow R}$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset 

 is the space of ordinary functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ f\,|\, f:\mathbb{\mathbb{R}\rightarrow R}\right\} $
\end_inset 

.
 The canonical example is  the Dirac delta oprator 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(x)$
\end_inset 

 which is zero everywhere, except at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset 

 where it is infinite.
 
\layout Standard

It seems intuitive that all other mappings from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset 

 that satisfy this invertability property are obtainable through the action
 of the permutation group, although one should always be careful with such
 statements..
 The permutation group elements are the shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor $
\end_inset 

 which acts as 
\begin_inset Formula $h:[a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},...]\mapsto[a_{2},a_{3},...]$
\end_inset 

 and the permuation operator 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{p,q}:[a_{1},...,a_{p},...,a_{q},...]\mapsto[a_{1},...,a_{q},...a_{p},...]$
\end_inset 

.
 Homework: give the analytic form for 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset 

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{p,q}(x)$
\end_inset 

 is discontinuous, but I think only on a countable set of points, and thus
 can be used to form well-defined integrals using classic techniques.

Graphs
\layout Standard

Here are some graphs.
\layout Standard

Define the Rieman sum as 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta_{N}(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-\frac{s}{N}\;\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}h\left(\frac{2n+1}{2N}\right)\;\left(\frac{2n+1}{2N}\right)^{s-1}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 As a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

, this sum converges very slowly to the Riemann zeta.
 A hint of the convergence properties is shown in the figure

The above strip charts show 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta_{N}(s)\right|$
\end_inset 

 for N=15, 151, 1051 and 11051 respectively.
 The three vertical black lines are located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s$
\end_inset 

=0, 1/2 and 1.
 The vertical range of these strips are all identical, ranging from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Im s$
\end_inset 

=13 at the bottom, to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Im s$
\end_inset 

=34 at the top.
 The coloration is such that red represents values greater than two, green
 for values about equal to one, and blue/black for values near/at zero.
 In this particular strip, we expect the exact Riemann zet to have five
 zeros, at 14.13, 21.02, 25.01, 30.42, and 32.93.
 Several remarkable properties are visible: First, there are far more than
 five zeros visible, some lying outside the critical strip.
 Next, as the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 increases, the zeros migrate towards the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s=1/2$
\end_inset 

 line; however, the number of zeros seems to multiply logarithmically as
 well.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 increases, though, most of these zeros will completely disappear; the mechanism
 is elucided in another set of charts.
