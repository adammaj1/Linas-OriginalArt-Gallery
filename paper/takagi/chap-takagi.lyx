Fractals and Continued Fractions seem to be deeply related in many ways.
 Farey numbers appear naturally in both.

Intro To be written.
 First we need to explain how to count with Farey numbers on the M-Set.
 Here is a picture stolen from Robert L.

This mapping and method of counting on the buds is well-known in the literature
 and is explored in many ways.
\layout Standard

Next we note that enumerating the group elements of the modular group as
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q\times\mathbb{N}}$
\end_inset 

 plays directly into the celebrated self-similarity of the Mandelbrot set.
\layout Standard

What does this mean for the symmetries of the Mandelbrot set? it means that
 the modular group maps buds to buds.
 Note, however, that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q\times\mathbb{N}}$
\end_inset 

 parameterization of the modular group means that one can map one bud onto
 any another, but that the mapping has to be onto the whole bud, and not
 just a portion of it.
 Put another way, it is a mapping of intervals to intervals.
 However, we can't just map any-old-interval anywhere we want.
 We can map an interval to any starting point that we wish (this is the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset 

 part of the symmetry, but after specifying the starting point, we have
 only a discrete set of intrvals we can map to: this is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

 part of the enumeration.
 The buds appear discretely on the boundaries of the main cardiod.
\layout Standard

Let us start with something simpler, with an example of an exactly-solvable
 fractal mapping.
\layout Subsection

The Takagi-Landsberg Curve
\layout Standard

The Takagi-Landsberg curve was first explored by Teiji Tagaki, circa 1903
 as an example of a continuous-everywhere, differentiable-nowhere curve
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-3}

\end_inset 

.
 It is constructed by positive mid-point displacements of straight line
 segments, that is, by 'fractally' bumping a line segment upwards by an
 increasingly smaller displacement (xxxx we should diagram the standard
 contruction here).
 Equivalently, one assigns geometrically smaller displacements to each level
 of the dyadic tree; that is, one picks some 
\begin_inset Formula $w<1$
\end_inset 

, and assigns to each dyadic number 
\begin_inset Formula $x=p/2^{n}$
\end_inset 

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n>1$
\end_inset 

, the value 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{p}{2^{n}}\right)=w^{n-1}+\frac{1}{2}\left[t_{w}\left(\frac{p-1}{2^{n}}\right)+t_{w}\left(\frac{p+1}{2^{n}}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset 

 where we anchor the recurrance with 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(0)=t_{w}(1)=0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(1/2)=1$
\end_inset 

.
 One extends this curve to all reals by 'linear interpolation' between the
 dyadic values, as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\tau\left(2^{k}x\right)\]

\end_inset 

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the triangle function:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
2(x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor ) & \textrm{\; for \;} & 0\leq x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor <1/2\\
2(\left\lfloor x+1\right\rfloor -x) & \textrm{\; for \;} & 1>x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor \geq1/2\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

 Note that insofar as the triangle curve is differentiable, we could say
 that the Takagi-Landsberg curve is differentiable (along 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

) as well, in that it has both leftward-going and rightward-going derivatives,
 although these derivatives differ at each dyadic point.
 We can choose to define the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $dt_{w}/dx$
\end_inset 

 by passing the 
\begin_inset Formula $d/dx$
\end_inset 

 past the usmmation above, to act on the triangle-wave, to give a square
 wave.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1/4}(x)=4x(1-x)$
\end_inset 

 is a parabola (the mid-point subdivision construction of a parabola is
 attributed to Archimedes
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-3}

\end_inset

 the tent 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)$
\end_inset 

 with any 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

 on the unit interval.
 To get a continuous Takagi curve, one must have 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

 continuous and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(0)=f(1)$
\end_inset 

.
 Discontinuous functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

 yeild curves that are discontinuous everywhere: for example, the square
 wave 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)=d\tau/dx=1-2\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor $
\end_inset 

 gives the self-similar shape shown below.
\layout Standard

Of the many possible different choices for 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

, the traingle wave is special in that it stays self-similar through iteration;
 that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tau\diamond\tau)(x)\equiv\tau^{2}(x)=\tau(2x)$
\end_inset 

 and generally, iterating on in 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

 times gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{k}(x)=\tau(2^{k}x)$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, we may write 
\begin_inset Formula \[

Symmetries of the Takagi-Landsberg Curve
\layout Standard

In this section, we will show that the Takagi-Landsberg curve transforms
 as a three-dimensional representation of the modular group.
 This provides an example where the action of the group can be precisely
 and completely specified.
 
\layout Standard

We recall from previous chapters that the modular group is generated by
 the interval contraction 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and the unit interval reflection 
\begin_inset Formula $r.$
\end_inset 

 We bear in mind that 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 are abstract group elements, and thus have distinct representations when
 acting on different sets.
 
\layout Standard

Consider first the generator that is the interval contraction 
\begin_inset Formula $g:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,1/2]$
\end_inset 

.
 It acts on the Takagi map as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[gt_{w}\right](x)=t_{w}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=x+wt_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 Iterating on this generator gives 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[g^{n}t_{w}\right](x)=t_{w}\left(\frac{x}{2^{n}}\right)=\frac{x}{2^{n-1}}\left(\frac{1-2^{n}w^{n}}{1-2w}\right)+w^{n}t_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 Next, we notice that the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 on the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $a+bx+ct_{w}(x)$
\end_inset 

 is both linear and is also closed, thus forming a vector space.
 That is, we have discovered that the Takagi Curve transforms under the
 three-dimensional represention of the modular group.
 To be explicit, we write a general element as the dot-product of a row
 of real numbers times a column of basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula \[
a+bx+ct_{w}(x)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a & \; b & \; c\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
x\\
t_{w}(x)\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Then, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 have the representations 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0\\
0 & 1 & w\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and \;}r_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
1 & -1\; & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 where we use the subscript 3 to denote this is the 3-D representation.
 Under tha action of this representation, 3-vectors transform as, for example,
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[gt_{w}\right](x)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & \;0 & \;1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0\\
0 & 1 & w\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
x\\
t_{w}(x)\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Previously, we had found the dyadic representation that acted on dyadic
 numbers as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2}\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and }\; r_{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & -1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 and so the 3D representation seems to be an extension of that vector space.
  The Takagi Curve is then seen to commute with the generators 
\begin_inset Formula $(g_{3}t_{w})(x)=(t_{w}g_{D})(x)$
\end_inset 

 and
\begin_inset Formula $(r_{3}t_{w})(x)=(t_{w}r_{D})(x)$
\end_inset 

 in this representation.
 
\layout Standard

For the sake of clarity, lets now examine the formulas for a contracting
 group element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}rg^{a_{3}}r...rg^{a_{N}}\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

.
 By 'contracting' we mean that we want to take all 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}\geq0$
\end_inset 

; as before, expanding and general group elements require us to compute
 intersections of the dyadic tree intervals, which proceeds as before but
 complicates the language.
 We have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 acts on the real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 with the dyadic representation: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma:x=\gamma_{D}(x)=\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}}}-\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}}}+\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}}}-...+(-)^{N+1}\frac{x}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+...+a_{N}}}\]

\end_inset 

 which can be quickly computed by multiplying together the representation
 matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{D}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{D}$
\end_inset 

.
 By contrast, on the Takagi curve, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 acts as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{3}$
\end_inset 

, thus: 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}(\gamma_{D}(x))=\left[\gamma_{3}t_{w}\right](x)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & \;0 & \;1\end{array}\right)g_{3}^{a_{1}}r_{3}g_{3}^{a_{2}}r_{3}g_{3}^{a_{3}}r_{3}...r_{3}g_{3}^{a_{N}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
x\\
t_{w}(x)\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 which demonstrates the self-symmetry of the curve for arbitrary (expanding)
 element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

.

What have we done here? We have accomplished two things.
 First, we've demonstrated the explict symmetry relationship of the Takagi
 Curve.
 Next, we've found that the curve, together with 1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

, belong to the set of basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\{1,x,t_{w}\}$
\end_inset 

 of a three-dimensional representation of the modular group.
 The matrix representations of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 make it very easy to compute how the curve transforms under any given element
 of the modular group.
 
\layout Description

Corollary: The modular group is a symmetry group of the parabola, where
 the parabola is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1/4}(x)=4x(1-x)$
\end_inset 

 and we can trivially validate that 
\begin_inset Formula $(t_{1/4}\circ g)(x)=t_{1/4}(x/2)$
\end_inset 

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $(g\circ t_{1/4})(x)=x+t_{1/4}(x)/4$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Description

Theorm: Every real (or complex!) value of 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

 generates a unique, inequivalent representation of the modular group.
 
\layout Description

Proof: If two representations were equivalent, then we could find a matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{v}=U^{-1}g_{w}U$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $v\neq w$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r=U^{-1}rU$
\end_inset 

.
 We try to do this by brute force.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula \[
U=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c\\
d & e & f\\
k & l & m\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Equating 
\begin_inset Formula $rU=Ur$
\end_inset 

 we find immediately that 
\begin_inset Formula $l=b=0$
\end_inset 

.
 Next, equating 
\begin_inset Formula $Ug_{v}=g_{w}U$
\end_inset 

 one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $d=k=c=f=0$
\end_inset 

, leaving 
\begin_inset Formula $a=e=m$
\end_inset 

.
 But when 
\begin_inset Formula $v\neq w$
\end_inset 

 we find also that 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset 

, and so all elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

 vanish.
 There is no equivalency transformation between two different representations.

Homework: In the previous section, we considered functions on the real number
 line as set-theoretic expressions of functions on the binary tree.
 The uniqueness of the Takagi curve for each distinct value of 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

 implies that we can use it to define a (partial) set of basis vectors on
 the binary tree.
 That is, there is a large class of functions on the unit interval 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

 that can be expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(x)=\int_{0}^{\infty}c(w)t_{w}(x)\; dw\]

\end_inset 

 for some function 
\begin_inset Formula $c:\mathbb{R}^{+}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

.
 Describe the completeness, or rather, the lack-threof, of this function
 basis.
 Notice that already have one trivial example: for the parabola 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=4x(1-x)$
\end_inset 

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $c(w)=\delta(w-1/4)$
\end_inset 

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset 

 is the Dirac delta function.

\end_inset 

 will generate other interesting sequences if we pick a different set of
 starting conditions.
 For example, taking 
\begin_inset Formula $w=0$
\end_inset 

, and writing 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}\equiv d$
\end_inset 

, using the initial conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $d(0)=0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d(1)=1$
\end_inset 

, we generate the tree of dyadic numbers between 0 and 1; that is, we can
 promptly deduce that 
\begin_inset Formula $d(x)=x$
\end_inset 

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $x=p/2^{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 If instead, we write 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}\equiv J$
\end_inset 

 with the boundary conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $J(1)=1$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J(1/2^{n})=2^{n}$
\end_inset 

, then we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset 

 generates the tree of dyadic numbers greater than one.

 of the unit interval onto itself.
 These maps consited of straight line segments, with each segments corresponding
 to an element of the modular group.
 Thus, for each individual line segment, the Takagi Curve is mapped back
 into itself under three dimensional representation, as shown above.
 Working out the general form of transformation of the curve under the hyperboli
c maps is a bit harder.

So far, we have been looking at the Takagi curve as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x,$
\end_inset 

 holding 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

 fixed.
 We can also explore the converse.
 For any fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

, the Takagi Curve is analytic in 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(0)=0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(1/2)=1$
\end_inset 

 are trivial, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(1/4)=w+1/2$
\end_inset 

 is clearly entire.
 Continuing, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{1}{2^{n}}\right)=\frac{2}{2^{n}}\;\frac{1-2^{n}w^{n}}{1-2w}\]

\end_inset 

 which is a polynomial of finite degree, without any poles, and thus entire;
 indeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1/2}(2^{-n})=2^{1-n}n$
\end_inset 

.
 Its not hard to see, for any integer 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(p/2^{n})$
\end_inset 

 will be a finite polynomial in

Mandelbrot Set; Douady-Hubbard Rays
\layout Standard

Douady Hubbard rays are a mapping of the unit circle to the boundary of
 the Mandelbrot Set.
 One of the properties is that a pair of rays pinches off each bud of the
 M-Set.
 Note that both of the rays occur at external angles that are also rationals.
 This now induces some additional symmetries on the rational numbers, since
 each bud can be labelled with a rational, and thus, for each rational,
 we associate the upper and lower rays.
 These two map are highly discontinuous.
 But that is OK, because the discontinuities pinch off the bud in the middle.
 We use the code-word substituion techniques of Doaudy-Hubbard to paste
 into the discontinuities.
 Since we are free to paste in any code-word desired, we have, in a certain
 sense, total and complete randomness, which is then propagated everywhere
 through the self-similarity.
 
\layout Standard

Here is a bizarro philosophical thought: we have complete freedom to choose
 the codewords to be pasted into the period-doubling symmetry, in the sense
 of philosophical free-will: we can choose as we wish.
 The result of the application of our free will is multiplied through the
 modular group so that choice now appears everywhere among the rationals.
 But we know that the closure of rationals is the reals, and we know that
 the reals are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

unknowable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the Turing-computable sense.
 Thus, we conclde that the application of free-choice results in something
 unknowable.
 How strange.
 
\layout Standard

Here's how code-word substitution works: start with the dyadic (base-2)
 expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq x\leq1$
\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
x=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{2^{n}}=0.a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}...\]

\end_inset 

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset 

 can only take on the values 0 and 1.
 Then pick any two integers 
\begin_inset Formula $h,l\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

 and a third integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $h,l<2^{m}$
\end_inset 

 is satisfied (alternately, we start by picking 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset 

 first, then picking 
\begin_inset Formula $h,l$
\end_inset 

 to satisfy this).
 We then substitute the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset 

 in the dyadic expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset 

 and the binary value of 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset 

 in the expansion with 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset 

, padding each appropriately:
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{h,l,m}(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{ha_{n}+l(1-a_{n})}{2^{n}2^{nm}}\]

\end_inset 

 which we now see as a highly discontinuous function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

.
 To get a better idea of why its called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

codeword substitution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, lets work an example.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.10101010101..._{2}$
\end_inset 

 and pick 
\begin_inset Formula $m=4$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h=7$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l=4$
\end_inset 

.
 Note that, in binary, 
\begin_inset Formula $h=0111_{2}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l=0100_{2}$
\end_inset 

 and so we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{7,3;4}(0.1010101..._{2})=0.0111\;0100\;0111\;0100\;0111\;..._{2}\]

\end_inset 

 
\layout Standard

Lets now work backwards and get the question mark: thus
\begin_inset Formula \[
?([2,1,1,1,...])=0.1010101..._{2}\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?([2,3,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3,1,1,...])=B_{7,3;4}(0.1010101..._{2})\]

\end_inset 

 blah blah why are we doing this again?

 Yada Yada.
 The mode-locked regions are called Sinai's toungues.
 This implies that the Modular Group is the symmetry group of the phase
 locked-loop (the circle map) as well as the Mandelbrot Set.
 
\layout Standard

Notice that the mode-locked regions of the circle map are exactly those
 regions that are *not* chaotic: in other words, these are the so-called
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

islands of order
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 that can be found in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

sea of chaos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 One of course sees such islands in other iterated equations, such as the
 iterated Feigenbaum map, and one is naturally lead to ask, is the modular
 group the symmetry group that maps islands into islands, for any period
 doubling map? What about the converse? Are there any maps, with islands,
 that do not have the Modular Form symmetry? 
\layout Standard

What about Misiurewicz points? Misiurewicz points on the M-set are the pre-perio
dic points.
 As such we expect to be able to label them in some way with xxx ???

3-period Mode Locking
\layout Standard

Note that some chaotic maps are seen to have period-doubling paths to chaos
 that include a factor of three: viz.
 3,6,12,24,...
 I'm not sure I think this is a manifestation of the fact that the modular
 group can be written as the free product of the two and three cycles 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{3}$

Iterating on the Hyperbolic Plane
\layout Standard

Of course, now that we know about the modular group and the hyperbolic plane,
 we state that we really want to study the iteration of one-dimensional
 maps like the logistic equation or the tent map by studying how it bounces
 around on the fundamental domain.
 That is, each time we iterate a 1-D map, we are bounced to somewhere else
 on the unit interval.
 This point on the unit interval is included in an enumerable set of line
 segments, which can be maped back to the whole unit interval via the modular
 group.
 Thus, a single point is a representative element of the equivalence class
 of all the points that the modular group maps it to.
 We want to study how the logistic equation acts on these equivalence classes,
 instead of asking how it acts on single points.
\layout Standard

Blah Blah Blah.
 Define what equivalence class means when a group acts on a set.
 viz define the quotient space.
 
\layout Standard

This is essentially how we get related to Julia sets.
 After we iterate a map like the logistic map once, we then ask what other
 points are in the same equivalence class, under the action of the modular
 group.
 That is, we now studay iteration in the quotient space, where the modular
 group provides the quotient.
 This quotient map is just the map of all hyperbolic triangles back to the
 fundamental domain.
 And so we really study iteration in this quotient space.
 Blah blah.
 Provide pretty pictures.
 We now ask what do the points on the boundary of the fundamental domain
 correspond to, blah blah, these are the Misiurewicz points, which is why
 they relate to Julia sets; they essentially paste together the pieces.
