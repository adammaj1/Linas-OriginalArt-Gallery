\begin_layout Title
Symmetries of Period-Doubling Maps

\begin_layout Abstract
The concept of self-similarity is central to the notion of a fractal, but
 the actual symmetry group that generates that self-similarity is rarely
 named, and it seems fractals are almost never studied according to their
 symmetries.
 Yet, in other branches of mathematics and physics, it is well understood
 that symmetry provides a powerful mechanism for understanding systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In this paper, we identify the symmetry group of period-doubling maps as
 being a monoid (semigroup) of the modular group 
\begin_inset Formula $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

.
 To anchor this assertion, we work out an explicit, exactly-solvable fractal
 curve, the Takagi or Blancmange Curve, as transforming under the three-dimensio
nal representation of the (monoid of the) modular group.
 By replacing the triangular shape that generates the Blancmange curve with
 a polynomial, we find that the resulting curve transforms under the 
\begin_inset Formula $n+2$
\end_inset

 dimensional representation of the monoid, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the degree of the polynomial.
 We also find that the (ill-defined) derivative of the Blancmange curve
 is essentially the (inverse of the) Cantor function, thus demonstrating
 the semigroup symmetry on the Cantor Set as well.
 In fact, any topologically conjugate map will transform under the three-dimensi
onal representation.
 We then show how all period-doubling maps can demonstrate the monoid symmetry,
 which is essentially an outcome of the dyadic representation of the monoid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This paper also includes a review of Georges deRham's 1958 construction
 of the Koch snowflake, the Levy C-curve, the Peano space-filling curve
 and the Minkowski Question Mark function as special cases of a curve with
 the monoid symmetry.
 The left-right symmetric Levy C-curve and the left-right symmetric Koch
 curve are shown each belong to another, inequivalent three dimensional
 representation.

This paper is part of a set of chapters that explore the relationship between
 the real numbers, the modular group, and fractals.
 Its also a somewhat poorly structured, written at least partly as a diary

It has been widely noticed that Farey numbers appear naturally in certain
 fractals, most famously in the Mandelbrot set.

 It demonstrates how to label and count buds on the Mandelbrot set using
 the Farey fractions.
 That the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

counting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is appropriate follows from the observation that both the sizes and locations
 of the buds correspond to the location of the fractions on the Farey or
 Stern-Brocot tree.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 shows how to count the buds of the Mandelbrot set by the Farey numbers.
 The reason why the Farey numbers are appropriate for such counting is somewhat
 more opaque.
 However, it can be said that many fractal phenomena, and in particular,
 period-doubling maps, have an infinite binary tree structure that appears
 naturally.
 By describing the nature of the self-symmetries of the binary tree, one
 can effectively describe the nature of the fractal in question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The infinite binary tree is self-similar, in that one can look at the subtree
 lying under any given node, and see that is isomorphic to the tree as a
 whole.
 A given subtree is easily and uniquely located: one may take a walk down
 the tree, taking either the left 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 or the right 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 branch.
 Thus, a given node on the tree may be specified by a sequence or string
 composed of the letters 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 are taken to be a  certain pair of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 matrices, then resulting set of strings turn out to be equivalent to a
 certain subset of the modular group 
\begin_inset Formula $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

.
 The modular group is critically important for a broad swath of number theory,
 from the theory of elliptic functions to the theory of modular forms.
 It seems remarkable that the symmetry structure of fractals are connected
 these topics, although, on closer examination, it turns out that what is
 remarkable is that the popular literature for the most part has not made
 this connection.
 The notable exception seems to be the popular book 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Indra's Pearls
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by David Mumford and Caroline Series (need ref).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More narrowly, the relationship between number theory and hyperbolic geometry
 meets in an area of mathematics known as ergodic theory.
 The group 
\begin_inset Formula $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

 is seen to be a special case of a Fuchsian group, which are generally the
 discrete subgroups of 
\begin_inset Formula $PSL(2,\mathbb{C})$
\end_inset

.
 These are implicated in a variety of chaotic dynamical systems, most notably
 in the ergodic or Anosov flow on the tangent space of 
\begin_inset Formula $PSL(2,\mathbb{C})$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the relationships between number theory and dynamical systems are
 known to mathematics; however, this knowledge has not yet escaped fairly
 narrow confines.
 In particular, many theorems in the area of dynamical systems are abstractly
 stated, and make no mention of exactly-solvable cases.
 Conversely, many areas of concrete number theory fail to emphasize or even
 point out the highly fractal nature of the relationships.
 Thus, it seems appropriate to work out in greater detail some concrete
 connections between fractals, the infinite binary tree, and the modular
 group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The focus of this paper is to elucidate how the infinite binary tree, the
 set of of all strings generated by two letters 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, and the set of period doubling fractals are related, and how their self-simila
rities can be precisely described.
 This is done in two parts.
 An earlier paper (need ref to my Minkowski question mark paper) deals with
 two-dimensional matrix representations, enumerating the elements of these
 sets, and questions about measure theory and the relationship to the Cantor
 set.
 This paper begins with a brief review of those results.
 It is then followed by a development of the three-dimensional matrix representa
tion for a very specific fractal, the Takagi curve, and then by various
 generalizations to broader cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first to be explored are the three-dimensional representations.
 It is shown that there are an uncountably infinite number of these, and
 that they may be labelled by a real or complex number.
 They are all inequivalent, in that there is no similarity transform that
 takes one into another.
 These occur naturally as the set of self-symmetries of the a family of
 fractal curves studied by Teiji Takagi in 1903
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tak1903"

\end_inset

, and further developed by G.H.
 Hardy in 1916 and by others.
 These now bear the name Takagi curve or blancmange curve.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Takagi curve is constructed from the iterated tent map.
 The three-dimensional representation can thus be shown to apply to any
 iterated map that is topologically conjugate to the tent map.
 The class of such curves is large, and contains many interesting specimens,
 such as the Logistic map of unit height.
 It is this observation that leads to a conjecture that essentially all
 period-doubling maps transform under the three-dimensional representation.
 In practice, however, there is a big difference between proving that a
 map is conjugate to the tent map, and giving explicit expression to the
 conjugating function.
 As an example, we show how one very simple iterated map is conjugate to
 the tent map, but the conjugating function is the Minkowski question mark
 function.
 Thus, finding the conjugating function is a non-trivial exercise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above introduction singled out some special matrices for 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 One may ask what happens if one picks some arbitrary matrices for 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, or even a pair of arbitrary functions, and then iterates on them by constructi
ng all possible strings containing 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 This question was explored by Georges de Rham in 1957
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeR57"

\end_inset

.
 He demonstrates that under certain broad conditions for the fixed points
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, any such generalized pair, when iterated, will produce a continuous but
 non-differentiable curve.
 A variety of classic fractal curves arise in this construction, including
 the Koch snowflake, the Levy C-curve, and the Peano space-filling curve.
 The fact that all of these curves can be identified with the set of strings
 in two letters implies that the general considerations about the self-similarit
y of binary trees can be applied to these cases

This section reviews the basics of the two-dimensional matrix representations
 of the self-similarities of the infinite binary tree.

A critical property of the Farey numbers is that they can be arranged on
 a binary tree, known as the Farey tree or Stern-Brocot tree, as shown in

\end_inset

 One may navigate to a particular location in the binary tree by starting
 at the root node (located at 
\begin_inset Formula $1/1$
\end_inset

), and making a sequence of left and right moves.
 The value of the Farey fraction labelling that node can be obtained by
 performing a simple matrix calculation.
 Let 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
L=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & 1\end{array}\right)\;\;\textrm{ and }\;\; R=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1\\
0 & 1\end{array}\right)\label{eq:L and R}\end{equation}

\end_inset

left
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 matrices.
 A sequence of moves, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $RLLLRRL$
\end_inset

, results in a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a & b\\
c & d\end{array}\right)\label{eq:matrix}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 with integer entries 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c,d$
\end_inset

.
 The value of the Farey number located at the corresponding node is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{a+b}{c+d}\]

\end_inset

 This is the simplest example of what I'll call a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

matrix representation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 associated with a binary tree.
 This particular representation is two-dimensional (it deals with 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 matrices), and will be called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Farey
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continued fraction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 representation, to distinguish it from other possible two-dimensional represent
ations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrix given above is unimodular: that is, its determinant is one.
 This can be easily seen because the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is one, and the determinant of a product of matrices is equal to the product
 of the determinants.
 The entries of the matrix are always integers, and thus its easily seen
 that the matrix belongs to the group of unimodular 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 matrices over the integers 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

.
 Given that the Farey fraction is given by the ratio, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-a & -b\\
-c & -d\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a & b\\
c & d\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 0\\
0 & -1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 gives the same fraction, we can see that the relevant matrices in fact
 belong to the 
\emph on
projective
\emph default
 group 
\begin_inset Formula $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

.
 This group is known as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Modular Group
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and it is central to many areas of number theory and in particular the
 theory of elliptic integrals and modular forms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternate labelling of an infinite binary tree is with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dyadic rationals
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, rational numbers of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $m/2^{n}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 an odd integer, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 a non-negative integer.
 This is very simply the tree with rows
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{0}{1}\quad &  & \quad\frac{1}{1}\\
 & \frac{1}{2}\\
\frac{1}{4}\qquad &  & \qquad\frac{3}{4}\\
\frac{1}{8}\qquad\frac{3}{8}\quad &  & \quad\frac{5}{8}\qquad\frac{7}{8}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 This tree, the dyadic rational tree, also has a matrix representation for
 converting a sequence of left-right moves to the value of the dyadic fraction
 located at the resulting node.
 The left and right dyadic matrices are 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
L_{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2}\end{array}\right)\;\;\textrm{ and }\;\; R_{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2}\end{array}\right)\label{eq:dyadic L and R}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and these generate what will be called the two-dimensional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dyadic representation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of moves on the binary tree.
 The value of the dyadic fraction after a sequence of moves is 
\begin_inset Formula $2c+d$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 are the entries in the matrix shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:matrix"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dyadic matrix that results from a sequence of left and right moves is
 clearly not unimodular.
 However, insofar as it labels a set of moves on the binary tree, it is
 isomorphic to the matrices arising in the Farey representation.
 There is a (unique) matrix corresponding to each node in the tree, and
 these can be trivially identified with one another.
 The representations are not, however 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

equivalent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: there does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 exist a similarity matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 that caries the one to the other.
 That is, the equations
\begin_inset Formula \[
SL_{D}=L_{C}S\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
SR_{D}=R_{C}S\]

\end_inset

 are satisfied only by 
\begin_inset Formula $S=0$
\end_inset

.
 Here, we wrote 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{C}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{C}$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:L and R"

\end_inset

, in order to distinguish them from the dyadic 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two representations are developed and examined in greater detail in
 another paper (ref my paper on Minkowski question mark), and the details
 will not be reproduced here; the focus of this paper are the three-dimensional
 and the higher-dimensional representations.
 However, there are several important points that must be noted, in order
 to avoid confusion.
 Most important is to understand that the moves on the binary tree are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 isomorphic to the modular group.
 Although it can be shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{C}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{C}$
\end_inset

 generate all of 
\begin_inset Formula $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

, the 
\emph on
non-negative
\emph default
 powers do not.
 The non-negative powers generate only what is called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monoid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

semigroup
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and not a full group, because the inverse elements are missing.
 The monoid does not contain the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{-1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{-1}$
\end_inset

 or any strings containing these elements.
 Although it may at first seem seem that the negative powers correspond
 to upward walks on the binary tree, this is not so.
 The meaning of the negative powers in terms of their action on the tree
 cannot be made consistent or even complete.
 Thus, while the monoid can be formally extended to a full group by adjoining
 the formal inverses, the resulting group no longer describes motion on
 a binary tree.
 That is, the monoid acts on the binary tree; but it is impossible to extend
 this action to an action of the full group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another critical aspect make note of is that the action of the monoid is
 an action on a certain set of intervals of the real number line.
 When the infinite binary tree is labelled either with the dyadic fractions
 or with the Farey fractions, it may be shown that any fraction occurring
 on the left is always strictly less then another fraction on the right.
 Thus, the binary tree extending under any given node has distinct and unique
 (Cauchy) limits to the left and to the right, thus defining an interval
 of the real number line.
 The subtree under any given node is clearly isomorphic to the tree as a
 whole.
 Finally, one may note that the dyadic rationals are dense in the reals,
 as are the Farey fractions.
 In fact, every rational shows up somewhere on the Farey tree.
 These properties make it clear that the act of navigating to any particular
 sub-node of the binary tree is the same as a map from one interval (say
 the unit interval) to a certain specific subinterval.
 It is not possible to navigate to just any interval whatsoever; these are
 constrained.
 A detailed discussion of which subintervals are allowed, and how to enumerate
 them, is given elsewhere (cf.
 my Minkowski question mark paper).
 Roughly, though, it may be said that the allowed intervals may be enumerated
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q\times\mathbb{N}}$
\end_inset

.
 It will become apparent, in the text of this paper, that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

allowed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 intervals are precisely those for which a period-doubling fractal is self-simil
ar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Numerical representations 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The set of strings in two letters is clearly isomorphic to the binary numbers,
 in that any given string in 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 can be converted to a string on 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, which may then be taken to be a binary number.
 Fractions such as 1/3, as well as irrational numbers correspond to strings
 of infinite length.
 A convenient alternate notation is in terms of continued fractions.
 One searches for a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 with the properties 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{2}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R=rLr$
\end_inset

.
 The first property suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is a 'reflection'.
 It follows from these properties that 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{n}=rL^{n}r$
\end_inset

 and so any string in 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 can be written as a string in 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 In what follows, the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is used for 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, so that the strings are in 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 A general string of the form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=L^{a_{1}}R^{a_{2}}L^{a_{3}}\ldots\]

\end_inset

 may therefore also be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}rg^{a_{3}}r...\]

\end_inset

While the first form has a natural representation in terms of a binary number,
 the second has a natural representation in terms of the continued fraction
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
[0;a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots]=\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}+\frac{1}{a_{3}+\ldots}}}\]

\end_inset

 The numerical value of these two forms are not the same; the explicit map
 between these two numerical representations is given by the Minkowski question
 mark function.
 For the dyadic representation 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{D}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{D}$
\end_inset

 of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dyadic L and R"

\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g_{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2}\end{array}\right)\;\;\textrm{ and }\;\; r_{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & -1\end{array}\right)\label{eq:dyadic g and d}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 while those corresponding to the Farey 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{C}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{C}$
\end_inset

are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g_{C}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & 1\end{array}\right)\;\;\textrm{ and }\;\; r_{C}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0\end{array}\right)\label{eq:farey g and d}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Interpreted as operators on the binary tree, 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 corresponds to taking the left branch, while 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a mirror-reflection of the tree.
 Expressed in terms of intervals, 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 maps an interval to the left-half of the interval, while 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is a reflection of the interval about its center point.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the label on a node of the dyadic tree (that is, if 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a real number), then one has the explicit representation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{D}(x)=\frac{x}{2}\quad\mbox{ and }\quad r_{D}(x)=1-x\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,1]$

.
 The above holds because the distribution of the dyadics is uniform with
 regards to the canonical topological measure on the real number line, and
 thus, any subtree will map back to the whole tree linearly.

\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(x)$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 for a fixed value of

 The fractal self-similarity of this curve is readily apparent.
 Other real values of

 It is constructed by positive mid-point displacements of straight line
 segments, that is, by 'fractally' bumping a line segment upwards by an
 increasingly smaller displacement (xxxx need a diagram of the standard
 Koch-Curve-like mid-point displacement construction here).
 Equivalently, one assigns geometrically smaller displacements to each level
 of the dyadic tree; that is, one picks some 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq w<1$
\end_inset

, and assigns to each dyadic number 
\begin_inset Formula $x=p/2^{n}$
\end_inset

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n>1$
\end_inset

, the value 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{p}{2^{n}}\right)=w^{n-1}+\frac{1}{2}\left[t_{w}\left(\frac{p-1}{2^{n}}\right)+t_{w}\left(\frac{p+1}{2^{n}}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset

where we anchor the recurrence with 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(0)=t_{w}(1)=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(1/2)=1$
\end_inset

.
 One extends this curve to all reals by 'linear interpolation' between the
 dyadic values, as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\tau\left(2^{k}x\right)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)$
\end_inset

 is the triangle function:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tau(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
2(x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor ) & \textrm{\; for \;} & 0\leq x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor <1/2\\
2-2(x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor ) & \textrm{\; for \;} & 1>x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor \geq1/2\end{array}\right.\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The curve is sometimes presented with 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-kH}$
\end_inset

 taking the place of 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{k}$
\end_inset

 in the series summation, where 
\begin_inset Formula $H=-\log_{2}w$
\end_inset

 is called the Hurst parameter (need ref).
 The value 
\begin_inset Formula $w=1/4$
\end_inset

 is special, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1/4}(x)=4x(1-x)$
\end_inset

 is a parabola.
 This can perhaps best be seen with the mid-point displacement construction
 of a parabola, which is attributed to Archimedes

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a certain technical sense, the curve is not differentiable at any dyadic
 value 
\begin_inset Formula $x=p/2^{n}$
\end_inset

, as such values correspond to the tip of the triangle wave, where the derivativ
e is ill-defined.
 However, one can still perform derivative-like manipulations with the curve,
 which will be explored in greater detail below.
 For example, one may choose to define the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $dt_{w}/dx$
\end_inset

 by passing the 
\begin_inset Formula $d/dx$
\end_inset

 past the summation, to act on the triangle-wave, replacing it with a square
 wave.
 The result is a curve that is discontinuous everywhere, but does have a
 number of derivative-like properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can generalize this curve in a variety of ways, for example, by replacing
 the tent 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)$
\end_inset

 with any 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 on the unit interval.
 To get a continuous Takagi curve, one must have 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 continuous and have 
\begin_inset Formula $f(0)=f(1)$
\end_inset

.
 Discontinuous functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 yield curves that are discontinuous everywhere: for example, the square
 wave 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)=d\tau/dx=1-2\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 gives the self-similar shape shown in the figures

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the many possible different choices for 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

, the triangle wave is special in that it stays self-similar through iteration;
 that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tau\diamond\tau)(x)\equiv\tau^{2}(x)=\tau(2x)$
\end_inset

 and generally, iterating on it 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 times gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{k}(x)=\tau(2^{k-1}x)$
\end_inset

 Thus, one may write

\begin_layout Subsection
Symmetries of the Takagi Curve
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section demonstrates that the Takagi curve transforms as a three-dimensiona
l representation of the tree-walking monoid.
 This provides an example where the action of the monoid can be precisely
 and completely specified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interval contraction generator 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 acts on the Takagi map as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[gt_{w}\right](x)=\left(t_{w}\circ g_{D}\right)(x)=t_{w}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=x+wt_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset

Iterating on this generator gives 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[g^{n}t_{w}\right](x)=t_{w}\left(\frac{x}{2^{n}}\right)=\frac{x}{2^{n-1}}\left(\frac{1-2^{n}w^{n}}{1-2w}\right)+w^{n}t_{w}(x)\label{eq: power of two value}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The action of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is considerably more trivial: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[rt_{w}\right](x)=\left(t_{w}\circ r_{D}\right)(x)=t_{w}\left(1-x\right)=t_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset

since the Takagi curve is left-right symmetric.
 Thus, it is easily seen that the actions of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 on a general expression 
\begin_inset Formula $a+bx+ct_{w}(x)$
\end_inset

 always returns another expression of the same type; and that the actions
 are both linear and also closed.
 That is, a general expression 
\begin_inset Formula $a+bx+ct_{w}(x)$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as a vector in a three-dimensional vector space, and
 the action 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 have representation as operators on that space.
 We have that the Takagi Curve transforms under a three-dimensional representati
on of the monoid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may be made explicit as follows.
 Write a general element of the vector space as the dot-product of a row
 of real numbers times a column of basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula \[
a+bx+ct_{w}(x)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a & \; b & \; c\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
x\\
t_{w}(x)\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

Then 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 have the representations 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0\\
0 & 1 & w\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and \;}r_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
1 & -1\; & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

where the subscript 3 is used to denote that this is a 3-D representation.
 Under the action of this representation, 3-vectors transform as, for example,
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[gt_{w}\right](x)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & \;0 & \;1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0\\
0 & 1 & w\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
x\\
t_{w}(x)\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

This should be compared to the transformation properties of dyadic numbers.
 By a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dyadic number
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we mean a real number represented as a string of binary digits
\begin_inset Formula \[
x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_{n}2^{-n}\]

\end_inset

with the binary digits 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset

 being either 0 or 1.
 By replacing the number 2 with a different number, it is easily seen that
 the dyadic representation forms a Cantor Set (discussed in greater detail
 below), and that it's self-similarity properties are also given by the
 same semigroup/monoid that describes the Takagi curve.
 However, the representation of the transformation properties is a two-dimension
al representation.
 That is, the dyadic representation that acted on dyadic numbers arranged
 in a doublet 
\begin_inset Formula $(1,x)$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2}\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and }\; r_{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & -1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

Alternately, one may write 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{D}(x)=x/2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{D}(x)=1-x$
\end_inset

 when acting on real numbers.
 The 3D representation is then seen to be a an extension of the 2D vector
 space.
 The Takagi Curve commutes with the generators as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[g_{3}t_{w}\right]\left(x\right)=\left(t_{w}\circ g_{D}\right)\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[r_{3}t_{w}\right](x)=\left(t_{w}\circ r_{D}\right)\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 where the left hand side is taken as an operator equation, and the right
 hand side as function composition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be further belabored by examining the formulas for a general contractin
g group element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}rg^{a_{3}}r...rg^{a_{N}}\in PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

.
 By 'contracting' we mean that we want to take all 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}>0$
\end_inset

.
 The contracting elements form the monoid, and we explicitly want to avoid
 considering the inverses of these group elements.
 Trying to incorporate the inverses significantly complicates the analysis,
 and a full inclusion of all inverses cannot be satisfactorily done.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 acts on the real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 with the dyadic representation: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma:x=\gamma_{D}(x)=\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}}}-\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}}}+...\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{N-1}}}+(-)^{N+1}\frac{x}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+\cdots+a_{N}}}\]

\end_inset

which can be quickly computed by multiplying together the representation
 matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{D}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{D}$
\end_inset

.
 By contrast, on the Takagi curve, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 acts as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{3}$
\end_inset

, thus: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\gamma_{3}t_{w}\right](x)=t_{w}(\gamma_{D}(x))=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & \;0 & \;1\end{array}\right)g_{3}^{a_{1}}r_{3}g_{3}^{a_{2}}r_{3}g_{3}^{a_{3}}r_{3}...r_{3}g_{3}^{a_{N}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
x\\
t_{w}(x)\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

which demonstrates the self-symmetry of the curve for arbitrary (contracting)
 element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\in PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

.
 That is, we have demonstrated an isomorphism between the set of contracting
 elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\in PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

 and a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $GL(3,\mathbb{R})$
\end_inset

 generated by 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that this isomorphism is only between subsets, and not subgroups:
 the monoid does not contain its inverses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equivalently, this set of contracting elements is isomorphic to the set
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\times\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
\end_inset

: pick any 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q\in\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset

 and set 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q=\gamma_{D}(0)$
\end_inset

 which fixes the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},...,a_{N-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Then pick a positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

 which fixes 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{D}(1)$
\end_inset

.
 This fixes the two endpoints of the interval that contains the self-similar
 portion of the Takagi curve.
 Then pick from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
\end_inset

 to decide if the mapping should invert the interval or not.
 Thus it is seen just how fine-grained, and also how constrained, the notion
 of self-similarity is.
 One may pick an interval one of whose endpoints may start on 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 rational, but once one endpoint has been specified, one only has a limited
 (albeit countably infinite) choice for the other endpoint.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Caution: The above has only demonstrated an isomorphism for the contracting
 (and their inverses, the expanding) group elements.
 General group elements also map intervals to intervals, but these may or
 may not be intersecting.
 When a pair of intervals do intersect, then there is a 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{D}(x)$
\end_inset

 that is valid and defined on the interval, and thus the Takagi curve, restricte
d to that interval, demonstrates the desired isomorphism.
 When a pair of intervals do not intersect, then we do not have this demonstrati
on, and so the above arguments fail.
 A rigorous treatment for general group elements seems to require a discussion
 of the topology of the modular group, of how to extend the mappings to
 the remaining group elements from those that can be easily handled.
 It is not clear if a consistent extension is possible, nor is it clear
 how to describe the obstruction if its not.
 This is beyond the level of the current presentation.

 First, the explicit symmetry relationship of the Takagi Curve has been

 Next, its been shown that the curve, together with 1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, belong to the set of basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\{1,x,t_{w}\}$
\end_inset

 of a three-dimensional representation of the monoid.
 The matrix representations of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 make it very easy to compute how the curve transforms under any given element
 of the monoid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Corollary: The modular group monoid is a symmetry group of the parabola,
 where the parabola is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1/4}(x)=4x(1-x)$
\end_inset

 and we can trivially validate that 
\begin_inset Formula $(t_{1/4}\circ g)(x)=t_{1/4}(x/2)$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $(g\circ t_{1/4})(x)=x+t_{1/4}(x)/4$
\end_inset

.
 The point here is that the monoid does not of necessity act only on fractal
 structures, but it can also act on differentiable structures as well.
 This action is seems considerably less exiting; however, it can be visualized
 as a mechanism for placing a

 for

 Let

 Equating 
\begin_inset Formula $rU=Ur$

 we find immediately that

 Next, equating

 one finds that

 But when

 we find also that

\end_inset

 Writing out the binary expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{D}(1)$
\end_inset

 in terms of binary digits 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\gamma_{D}(1) & = & \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{k}}{2^{k}}\nonumber \\
\, & = & \begin{array}{ccccc}
0. & \underbrace{000...000} & \underbrace{111...111} & \underbrace{000...000} & ...\\
\, & a_{1} & a_{2} & a_{3} & \,\end{array}\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 where, as usual, one takes the expansion such that the final binary digits
 repeat forever, without upsetting the count 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}$
\end_inset

 of the previous digits; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
b_{k}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
1 & \;\textrm{ for N odd, }\; & \forall k>M\\
0 & \;\textrm{ for N even, }\; & \forall k>M\end{array}\right.\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 can then be expressed directly in terms of this binary expansion.
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
q_{\gamma}(w)=\frac{(-)^{N}}{2^{M-1}}\sum_{k=1}^{M}(2b_{k}-1)\;(2w)^{k-1}\]

\end_inset

 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 is more-or-less equal (up to a factor and a term of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/(1-2w)$
\end_inset

) to the derivative
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\frac{dt_{w}(x)}{dx}\right|_{x=\gamma_{D}(1)}\]

\end_inset

 We say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

more or less
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 because some care has to be taken to define which bit expansion defines
 the derivative.
 In a certain sense,

 is the dis-ambiguated derivative.
 This is left as an exercise.

\begin_layout Standard
The polynomials being dealt with here are closely related to the inverse
 of the Cantor function.
 This is perhaps best presented visually.
 Write the binary expansion of a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{k}}{2^{k}}\label{eq: binary expansion}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and then define its Cantorization as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{z}(x)=(1-z)\,\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}b_{k}z^{k}\]

\end_inset

 Clearly, for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1/2$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1/2}(x)=x$
\end_inset

 For 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1/3$
\end_inset

 in the figure

This figure shows a graph of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset

 for a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1/3$
\end_inset

.
 This graph provides possibly the easiest visual proof that the cardinality
 of the Cantor Set is equal to the cardinality of the unit interval
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Can1884"

\end_inset

, a result which can sometimes be difficult to visualize.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1/3}(x)$
\end_inset

 maps the unit interval into the unit interval.
 It is strictly monotonically increasing, and if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\neq y$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1/3}(x)\neq c_{1/3}(y)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, this function is one-to-one, and thus the cardinality of the image
 is equal to the cardinality of the unit interval.
 But the image of this function is just the canonical Cantor set, constructed
 by recursively removing the open middle-third interval.
 The largest 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

middle-third
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

; the next two largest correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x=3/4$
\end_inset

, and so on: each removed interval corresponds to a rational number, expressed
 as its binary expansion.
 It is not hard to see that that the sum of the lengths of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

middle thirds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 adds up to one, and thus, the measure of the image of this function is
 zero.
 Thus, we have quickly sketched that the cardinality of the Cantor set is
 that of the real numbers, but the Lebesgue measure of the Cantor Set is
 zero.
 It is not hard to see that one gets a similar result using 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset

 for any value of 
\begin_inset Formula $0<z<1/2$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There were only two 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tricky
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 parts to this demonstration.
 One is the assertion that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)\neq c_{z}(y)$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $x\neq y$
\end_inset

, but this can be deduced easily enough by contemplating the definition
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 The other trick we slid by here was that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset

 is somewhat vaguely defined for the rationals: every dyadic rational number
 
\begin_inset Formula $x=p/2^{n}$
\end_inset

 has two inequivalent binary expansions.
 For example, x=1/2=0.1000...=0.0111...
 and the first binary expansion yields 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(1/2)=1-z$
\end_inset

 while the second yields 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(1/2)=z$
\end_inset

.
 But this doesn't affect the proof: however we choose to tighten up the
 definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset

, it is still one-to-one and monotonic, and its image still has the cardinality
 of the unit interval.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For larger values of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, one can more clearly see the visual resemblance of the Cantor polynomial
 to the derivative of the Takagi function.
 The resemblance is not accidental; they really are the same thing, as long
 as one takes care to properly define which binary expansion one is working
 with.
 The details are not given here, although they are not hard to work out
 (see homework problem below).
 The essential point is that every rational number has two possible binary
 expansions: for example, it is well known that 
\begin_inset Formula $1.000..=0.111...$
\end_inset

 .
 But each such expansion yields two inequivalent Cantor polynomials.
 Cantor's essential insight was that these two inequivalent representations
 of the real numbers by binary sequences can be re-interpreted as the endpoints
 of a set of non-overlapping line segments.
 Converting the binary sequence into a polynomial series in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 make these two endpoints explicit by assigning a different polynomial to
 each.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another language one can use to describe this is to say that there is a
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gap
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at every dyadic fraction i.e.
 at every rational of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $p/2^{n}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 odd and integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n>0$
\end_inset

.
 This gap is inherent in the representation of the reals by binary sequences.
 The gap orders all of the reals above and below it.
 Note that there is another construction by which one can place gaps at
 every rational number.
 This construction is arrived at through the isomorphism between dyadic
 fractions and Farey Numbers by means of the Minkowski Question Mark function.
 Essentially, we can represent every rational as a continued fraction, and
 define gaps analogously.
 This idea is reviewed in the companion paper.

The main insight provided here is that the two endpoints of Cantor's interval
 construction can also be mapped to the left and right derivatives of the
 Takagi function.
 That is, for any dyadic rational 
\begin_inset Formula $p/2^{n}$
\end_inset

 for odd integer 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, there are two inequivalent binary sequences that represent this rational.
 Each sequence can be used to build a distinct polynomial.
 The value of two polynomials at the rational are the two endpoints of an
 interval in the Cantor Set construction.
 But these two endpoints are also the left and right derivatives of the
 Takagi Curve.
 One sequence maps to the derivative of the Takagi function on one side
 of this rational, and the other to the other side of this rational.

Homework: Make the above statements firm by providing all the correct factors
 needed to relate the Cantor polynomial

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\gamma}(w)$
\end_inset

 and to the suitably firmed-up derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $dt_{w}(x)/dx$
\end_inset

.
 Start by noticing that the traditional derivative is ill-defined only at
 dyadic fractions; for all other rationals and irrationals, there is no
 problem.
 In particular, the dyadic fractions are a set of measure zero; the derivative
 is well-defined on a set of measure one.
 At the dyadic fractions, use the gap to assign left and right derivatives,
 and give an exact expression for each.

\begin_layout Description
Homework: The classic example of a Cantor Set is built by means of a dyadic
 subdivision of the unit interval.
 Because of this, we can apply the monoid symmetry here as well.
 How do the limit points of the Cantor set (the points that are not the
 endpoints of intervals) behave under the dyadic monoid? Given that the
 Cantor set can be mapped to the real numbers (the cardinality of the Cantor
 set is the cardinality of the continuum), can we work backwards to deduce
 the action of the modular group monoid on the real number line?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presumably, it should be obvious by now that the Cantor Polynomials transform
 as the two-dimensional (dyadic) representation of the period-doubling monoid.
 This should be expected, based on the reasoning about the dimension of
 the representation presented in the next section.
 XXX These last few paragraphs are a less-than satisfying treatment.

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 suggests a mathod for defining a measure on Cantor sets.
 One starts with the ordinary Lebesgue measure on the real number line,
 and passes it through the Cantor polynomial, defined above, and ask how
 that measure accumulates on the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-axis.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $z<1/2$
\end_inset

, this mapping defines a distribution that is discontinuous: the measure
 accumulates on the points in the Cantor set, and is vanishing elsewhere.
 Essentially, the distribution is that of the membership function of a set.
 The membership function is a function that is equal to one for points in
 a set, and zero for points not in the set.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $z>1/2$
\end_inset

, however, the sawtooth graph makes clear that intervals on the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-axis will be projected to a multitude of overlapping intervals on the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-axis.
 One may ask what the resulting distribution is on the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-axis.
 The following figures illustrate the answer.

\begin_layout Section
The Four-Dimensional Representation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replacing the sawtooth shape that defines the the Takagi function with a
 polynomial leads to a curve that transforms under a higher-dimensional
 representation, specifically, as the degree of the polynomial plus two.
 This section works out the four-dimensional representation and then presents
 the general finite-dimensional representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets replace the sawtooth by a quadratic shape
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\alpha(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
4x^{2} & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 0\leq x\leq1/2\\
4(1-x)^{2} & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
a_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\alpha\left(2^{k}x-\left\lfloor 2^{k}x\right\rfloor \right)\]

\end_inset

 Its not hard to find that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[g_{4}a_{w}\right](x)\equiv\left(a_{w}\circ g_{D}\right)(x)=a_{w}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=x^{2}+wa_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset

 Combining this with the reflection 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x)=1-x$
\end_inset

, it is seen again that the transformations are linear and closed, and thus
 again a vector space, this time four-dimensional.
 The generator 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{4}$
\end_inset

can be represented as the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{4}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4} & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & w\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 and the reflection 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x)=1-x$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
r_{4}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
1 & -1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & -2 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 with the constructions of the isomorphisms proceeding as before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)$
\end_inset

 is replaced with another quadratic construction that is even about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

, then the corresponding generator 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 will be conjugate to 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{4}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, if we were to construct the curve from 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\beta(x)=4x(1-x)\]

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\beta\left(2^{k}x-\left\lfloor 2^{k}x\right\rfloor \right)\]

\end_inset

 then we'd find that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{b}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4} & 0\\
0 & 2 & -1 & w\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 is conjugate to 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{4}$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $Ug_{4}=g_{b}U$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
U=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & \frac{4}{1-2w} & \frac{-4}{1-2w} & \frac{-2w}{1-2w}\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 Note that this conjugacy breaks down when 
\begin_inset Formula $w=1/2$
\end_inset

.
 This is because the curve generated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)$
\end_inset

 becomes a parabola at this point; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1/2}(x)=4x(1-x)$
\end_inset

, which transforms under the three-dimensional, not the four-dimensional
 representation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also construct a function that is odd about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\beta_{o}(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
16x(1/2-x) & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 0\leq x\leq1/2\\
16(1-x)(1/2-x) & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 which is a pair of oppositely oriented parabolas.
 We use the subscript 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

o
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to denote odd parity.
 A graph looks like a rude, crude version of the sine function.
 We then have 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{o}(1-x)=-\beta_{o}(x)$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{o,w}(1-x)=-b_{o,w}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 The representation for 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 for this function has an extra minus sign: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
r_{4o}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
1 & -1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & -2 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 and cannot be made conjugate to 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{4}$
\end_inset

; that is, there does not exist a 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\, U\neq0$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $Ur_{4o}U^{-1}=r_{4}$
\end_inset

.
 The rep for 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{4o}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4} & 0\\
0 & 4 & -4 & w\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{o,w}(g(x))=4x(1-x)+wb_{o,w}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 So in fact, for a fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, we have two 4D representations, of even and odd parity, that aren't conjugate.
 Working backwards, we realize that there is actually another 3D representation,
 of odd parity, that is not conjugate to the even-parity representation.
 It is the one that is built out of the shifted sawtooth

\sigma(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
4x & \;\textrm{ for }\; & 0\leq x\leq1/4\\
2-4x & \;\textrm{ for }\; & 1/4\leq x\leq3/4\\
4x-4 & \;\textrm{ for }\; & 3/4\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and give an odd-parity representation because 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(1-x)=-\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Under 
\begin_inset Formula $g,$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(g(x))=\tau(x)+w\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

.
 However, if we try to work out the matrix representation 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{3o}$
\end_inset

 for this function, we find that the bottom row of the matrix has elements
 that aren't constants, but are rather piece-wise assemblies that depend
 on whether 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is greater or less than 1/2.
 Strictly speaking, then, this isn't a linear representation.
 We can try to save the day by building a different odd-parity sawtooth;
 but then we find that such a sawtooth will be discontinuous at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 and/or at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, there doesn't seem to be a continuous odd-parity representation
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $GL(3,\mathbb{R})$
\end_inset

.
 There is, however, an odd-parity representation in 
\begin_inset Formula $GL(3,\mathbb{R})$
\end_inset

 that is not continuous: it is the one built from 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)=x-1/2$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the most part, we've tried to be careful to choose functions that yield
 a continuous Takagi curve.
 One can build discontinuous curves by working with the square-wave.
 The square-wave, in a certain sense, transforms as the 2D rep.
 Curiously, the odd-parity quadratic above has a continuous first derivative.
 We can in fact build an even-parity quadratic with a continuous first derivativ
e, by following the same recipe:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\beta_{e}(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
1-16x^{2} & \;\textrm{ for }\; & 0\leq x\leq1/4\\
16(x-1/2)^{2}-1 & \;\textrm{ for }\; & 1/4\leq x\leq3/4\\
1-16(1-x)^{2} & \;\textrm{ for }\; & 3/4\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This is explicitly even: 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{e}(1-x)=\beta_{e}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 A graph of this looks like a rude, crude version of the cosine.
 If we try to work out the matrix representation 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{4e}$
\end_inset

 for this function, we run into difficulty again: the bottom row of the
 matrix has elements that aren't constants, but are rather piece-wise assemblies
 that depend on whether 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is greater or less than 1/2.
 It seems that there isn't any even-parity quadratic function with continuous
 first derivatives that has a matrix representation in 
\begin_inset Formula $GL(4,\mathbb{R})$
\end_inset

.
 This seems to mirror the odd-parity problem for the 3D rep.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Higher-Dimensional Representations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should now be apparent how to build arbitrary higher-dimensional representati
ons.
 One can, for instance, start with 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\alpha_{n}(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
2^{n}x^{n} & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 0\leq x\leq1/2\\
2^{n}(1-x)^{n} & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and discover that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[g_{n+2}a_{n,w}\right](x)\equiv\left(a_{n,w}\circ g_{D}\right)(x)=a_{n,w}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=x^{n}+wa_{n,w}(x)\]

\end_inset

 The matrix representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 has inverse powers of 2 along the diagonal, except for the last row, and
 the reflection matrix is lower-triangular, with binomial coefficients making
 up the triangle (excluding the last row).
 If one attempts different constructions by replacing the monomial 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n}x^{n}$
\end_inset

 with a polynomial, but keeping 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{n}$
\end_inset

 even about 1/2, then one finds that all these representations are conjugate
 to each other.
 Alternately, we can construct 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{n}$
\end_inset

 so that it is odd about 1/2; in this case, we again find that all the represent
ations are equivalent up to conjugacy.
 Thus, we conclude that for any given dimension, there are two distinct
 representations, which we shall call even and odd, according to the symmetry
 of the Takagi curve that forms the basis vector.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{n}(x)$
\end_inset

 is explicitly even-parity, but its first derivative is discontinuous at
 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

.
 One can then try to build even and odd-parity functions of a given degree,
 with continuous 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-1)$
\end_inset

'th derivatives.
 The corresponding representations then succeed or founder as in the 3D/4D
 cases above, with even and odd order functions alternately causing the
 piecewise-trouble for even and odd representations.
 That is, one of the two representations will allow Takagi curves that are
 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

 times differentiable, while the other can work only up to 
\begin_inset Formula $n-2$
\end_inset

.
 The obvious choice for the differentiable-curve construction are the Bernoulli
 polynomials.
 These have several appealing properties for this task: they alternate in
 parity as they alternate in order, and, in higher orders, approximate sine
 and cosine.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{2n}(x)\rightarrow\pm A_{2n}\cos(2\pi x)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{2n+1}(x)\rightarrow\pm A_{2n+1}\sin(2\pi x)$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 for some constants 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, we assert that an appropriate and natural choice for the basis
 vectors for the higher-dimensional representations are given by Bernoulli
 polynomials.
 We thus define the basis vectors to be 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
T_{n+}(x;w)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}B_{n}\left(2^{k}x-\left\lfloor 2^{k}x\right\rfloor \right)\]

\end_inset

 for the one parity, and, for the opposite parity, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
T_{n-}(x;w)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\check{B}_{n}\left(2^{k}x-\left\lfloor 2^{k}x\right\rfloor \right)\]

\end_inset

 where we define 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\check{B}_{n}(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
B_{n}(2x)-B_{n}(1) & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 0\leq x\leq1/2\\
(-)^{n}\left(B_{n}(1)-B_{n}(2(1-x))\right) & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The next chapter will explore these expressions in greater detail, xxxxxxxx
 fix the above to match basis used in other chapters.

\begin_layout Standard
Given that higher and higher degree polynomials require higher and higher-dimens
ional representations, this implies that a Takagi curve built out of a general
 function will in some way transform as an 'infinite dimensional' representation.
 We find it curious, though, that alternating even and odd-parity representation
s seem to allow sine and cosine to be built up in a natural fashion, thus
 opening the door for Fourier analysis

 Insofar as the exponential can be considered to be a polynomial of infinite
 degree, or to be constructed as the limit of a series of polynomials, then
 one might expect these functions to transform under some 'infinite-dimensional'
 representation, taken as a limit of the above development for polynomials.

\begin_layout Standard
It can be readily worked out that the factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2l+1$
\end_inset

, which is needed to enumerate the eigenfunctions, does not add any new
 or interesting complications to the overall symmetry.
 With a minimum of effort, one can quickly see that these curves transform
 in a fashion similar to the Takagi Curve.
 Starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $g,$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[g\psi_{z,l}\right](x)=\left[\psi_{z,l}g\right](x)=\psi_{z,l}(\frac{x}{2})=\exp\left((2l+1)\pi ix\right)+z\psi_{z,l}(x)\]

\end_inset

 and for reflection,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[r\psi_{z,l}\right](x)=\left[\psi_{z,l}r\right](x)=\psi_{z,l}(1-x)=\psi_{z,l}(-x)\]

\end_inset

 Concatenating group elements proceeds in a fashion similar to before.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{D}^{3}r_{D}g_{D}^{2}(x)=\frac{1}{8}-\frac{x}{32}\]

\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[g^{3}rg^{2}\psi_{z}\right](x)=\psi_{z}\left(\frac{1}{8}-\frac{x}{32}\right)=\exp\left(i\pi\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{x}{16}\right)\right)+z\psi_{z}\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{x}{16}\right)\]

\end_inset

 where we've taken, for convenience, 
\begin_inset Formula $l=0$
\end_inset

.
 Peeling off one group element at a time, we finally get 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\psi_{z}\left(\frac{1}{8}-\frac{x}{32}\right) & = & \exp\left(i\pi\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{x}{16}\right)\right)+z\,\exp\left(i\pi\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{x}{8}\right)\right)+\nonumber \\
 & + & z^{2}\exp\left(i\pi\left(1-\frac{x}{4}\right)\right)+z^{3}\exp\left(-i\pi\frac{x}{2}\right)+\nonumber \\
 & + & z^{4}\exp\left(-i\pi x\right)+z^{5}\psi_{z}\left(-x\right)\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 However, this obscures the true form of the transformation, which is exhibited
 more clearly if we write the above as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
g^{3}rg^{2}\psi_{z} & = & \psi_{z}g^{3}rg^{2}\nonumber \\
 & = & Eg^{3}rg^{2}+z\, Eg^{2}rg^{2}+z^{2}Egrg^{2}+z^{3}Erg^{2}+z^{4}Erg+z^{5}\psi_{z}r\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 where we defined 
\begin_inset Formula $E(x)\equiv\exp(2\pi ix)=\psi_{z=0}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Just to be perfectly clear, in the above expression, we mean functional
 composition whenever two elements are next to each other, with the exception
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, which is just plain multiplication.
 The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 has the effect of peeling off one group element at a time, and converting
 it to a 
\begin_inset Formula $z.$
\end_inset

 The result is a funny polynomial which captures the action of the group
 element.
 The funny polynomial is the orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{z}$
\end_inset

 under the action of a general group element.
 We abstain from trying to write the corresponding polynomial for the general
 element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}rg^{a_{3}}r...rg^{a_{N}}$
\end_inset

 mostly because it would be quite ungainly.
 We note only that the highest power of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 will be 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{N}$
\end_inset

 and also that 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 can take the place of a minus sign, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $(Er)(x)=E(r(x))=E(1-x)=E(-x)$
\end_inset

, which remains in place, until the next 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 cancels it out.
 None-the-less, this polynomial is curious, and calls for further development.

\begin_layout Section
Topologically Conjugate Maps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Modular Group Symmetry describes not just this peculiar handful of curves,
 but in fact a large class of curves.
 Any monotonically increasing function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(x)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(0)=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(1)=1$
\end_inset

 can be used to build topologically conjugate maps.
 For the tent map, we write 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)=(\phi\circ\tau\circ\phi^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
s_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}(\phi\circ\tau^{k+1}\circ\phi^{-1})(x)\]

\end_inset

 which transforms under the action of 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{\phi}(x)=(\phi\circ g_{D}\circ\phi^{-1})(x)\]

\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[gs_{w}\right](x)\equiv s_{w}(g_{\phi}(x))=x+ws_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset

 This transformation law follows rather trivially, because we had 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{n+1}g_{D}=\tau^{n}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tau g_{D})(x)=(1)(x)=x$
\end_inset

.
 In the same vein, we define 
\begin_inset Formula \[
r_{\phi}(x)=(\phi\circ r_{D}\circ\phi^{-1})(x)\]

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{D}(x)=1-x$
\end_inset

.
 Working with these two generators, we can construct the generic element
 very easily, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\phi}=\phi\circ\gamma_{D}\circ\phi^{-1}$
\end_inset

, and discover, of course, that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{w}$
\end_inset

 transforms under exactly the same three-dimensional representation that
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}$
\end_inset

 does.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets quickly examine a specific example, the Logistic map of unit height.
 This map is conjugate to the tent map, and the conjugating functions are
 given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\phi(x)=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\cos\left(\pi x\right)\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\phi^{-1}(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}\arccos\left(1-2x\right)\]

\end_inset

 so that we get 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda(x)\equiv(\phi\circ\tau\circ\phi^{-1})(x)=4x(x-1)\]

\end_inset

 Then, iterating on this map, we get 
\begin_inset Formula \[
L_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\lambda^{k+1}(x)\]

\end_inset

 The generators of the symmetry group for this conjugating function are
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{\phi}(x)=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1-x}\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\phi}(x)=r_{D}(x)=1-x$
\end_inset

.
 The graph of this curve is not that interesting and generally resembles
 that of the Takagi Curve shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:The-Takagi-Landsberg-Curve"

\end_inset

, and thus we do not graph it here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although constructed from a parabola, do not confuse this curve with the
 curve that transforms under the 4D rep: this is because 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{k+1}(x)\neq\lambda(2^{k}x)$
\end_inset

: in one case, we are iterating, in the other, we are making copies.
 In the above discussion, we've conflated two different concepts: the act
 of iteration, and the construction of the Takagi curve.
 We can do this because iterating the tent map just makes copies of the
 map: 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{k+1}(x)=\tau(2^{k}x)$
\end_inset

.
 This is generally not the case for other maps, and the tent map is unique
 in this way (XXX??? right? or is there some other bizarre map that behaves
 like this?) Thus, we have an important corollary here: 
\series bold
curves generated by iterated maps always transform under the three-dimensional
 representation, and not the higher-dimensional representations
\series default
.
 The higher-dimensional representations cannot be made conjugate to iterated
 maps, because if they could be, they'd transform under the three-dimensional
 rep, a contradiction.
 We've subtly failed to mention one limitation: not all iterated maps can
 be made conjugate to the tent map.
 It is not clear to this author, at this time, which maps can and cannot
 be made conjugate to the tent map, and answering this question should provide
 insight into the nature of iteration.

 This map is conjugate to the tent map, although the conjugating function
 is not analytic: it is the Minkowski Question Mark: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F(x)=(?^{-1}\circ\tau\circ?)(x)\]

\end_inset

 Iterating on this map give curve shown in the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The symmetry generators are 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{?^{-1}}(x)=r_{C}(x)=r_{D}(x)=1-x$
\end_inset

.
 These are the generators explored in a previous chapter.
 Notice that the local minima in the graph correspond to the Farey Fractions,
 of course.
 Of interest here is that these arise out of iteration: the Farey Fractions
 are the

 of the fixed point at zero.
 Given any Farey Fraction, the Isola map will iterate them to zero after
 a finite number of steps.
 Insofar as the Farey Fractions are dense on the unit interval, then the
 Julia Set of the iterated Isola Map is the whole unit interval.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 that a map should be conjugate to the Tent map.
 We were lucky to know that the Minkowski Question Mark was what was needed:
 it would be very difficult to construct from first principles.
 The Isola map is deceptively simple: it has a simple analytic form, yet
 the conjugating function is highly singular.
 In view of this difficulty, it is of some merit to create a dictionary
 of conjugating functions and describe the structure of the space of functions
 that are conjugate to the Tent Map.

The de Rham Construction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a classic 1957 paper
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeR57"

\end_inset

, Georges de Rham constructs a class of curves, and proves that these curves
 are everywhere continuous but are nowhere differentiable (more precisely,
 are not differentiable at the rationals).
 In addition, he shows how the curves may be parameterized by a real number
 in the unit interval.
 The construction is simple.
 This section illustrates some of these curves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a pair of contracting maps of the plane 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{1}:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 By the Banach fixed point theorem, such contracting maps should have fixed
 points 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Assume that each fixed point lies in the basin of attraction of the other
 map, and furthermore, that the one applied to the fixed point of the other
 yields the same point, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
d_{1}(p_{0})=d_{0}(p_{1})\label{eq:continuity condition}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Then these maps can be used to construct a certain continuous curve between
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Consider next the expansion in binary digits of a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, as given previously in eqn.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
x=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{k}}{2^{k}}\]

\end_inset

 The de Rham curve is then a map characterized by the continuous parameter
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
d_{x}=d_{b_{1}}\circ\; d_{b_{2}}\circ\,\ldots\:\circ\, d_{b_{k}}\circ\,\ldots\label{eq:de-Rham curve}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The above map will map points in the common basin of attraction of the
 two maps to a single point.
 De Rham provides a simple proof that the resulting set of points form a
 continuous curve as a function of

De Rham provides several examples.
 Let

\begin_inset Formula $|a|<1$

 Then consider the maps 
\begin_inset Formula \[

 These two maps clearly have fixed points at

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}$

\end_inset

 transformations are essentially the 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 operators from the introduction of this paper.
 Although these are represented by three-dimensional linear transformations,
 there is no equivalent to the transformations 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 This is because for every case, with the exception of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1/2$
\end_inset

, the curves are not left-right symmetric, and so there is no matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{2}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L=rRr$
\end_inset

 Furthermore, there is not even an 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $L=s^{-1}Rs$
\end_inset

 This last result is perhaps a bit unexpected, and to be explored further.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1/2$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[

 The corresponding

\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $sL=Rs$
\end_inset

 However, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1/2$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $rL=Rr$

\begin_inset Formula $r$

 takes the same form as

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[

Yet another example of a curve generated by means of the de Rham construction

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[

 More precisely, the generated function is actually half the inverse:

\begin_layout Standard
From the construction properties, it should now be clear that this generalized
 de Rham curve construction has the same set of modular-group self-similarities;
 this essentially follows from the self-similarity properties of the Cantor
 polynomials.
 That is, given a contracting group element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}rg^{a_{3}}r...rg^{a_{N}}\in PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

, one defines its action in the canonical way, on the parameter space, as
 an action on dyadic intervals: thus 
\begin_inset Formula \[
gd_{x}=d_{x/2}\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
sd_{0}=d_{1}\qquad d_{0}=s^{-1}d_{1}\]

\end_inset

 Note that the above is not just a statement about some particular value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, but is rather a statement that holds true for the entire range of parameters
 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

; it is a statement of the self-similarity properties of the curve.

The lesson to be learned here bears stating clearly: 
\series bold
\emph on
every point on the above-mentioned curves can be uniquely labelled by a
 real number.
 The labelling is not abstract, but concrete.
 The fractal self-similarity of the curves are in unique correspondence
 to the contracting semi-group of the modular group.
 To every element of the contracting semi-group, a unique non-degenerate
 mapping of the plane can be given that exactly maps the curve into a a
 self-similar subset of itself.
 The mapping is continuous, and can be expressed in concrete form.

The Total Number of Linear, Planar Dyadic Fractal Curves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above exposition, in terms of the action of left and right affine transforma
tions, indicates that it is possible to count the total number of uniquely
 distinct dyadic planar fractal curves, and to classify them into families.
 The general linear, dyadic planar fractal curve is given by iterating on
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{0}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
a & b & c\\
d & e & f\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and \;}d_{1}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}

h & j & k\\
l & m & n\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,\ldots,n$
\end_inset

 are taken as real numbers.
 From this general set, one wants to exclude the cases which are rotated,
 translated, scaled or squashed versions of one another.
 The general set appears to have twelve free parameters, from which should
 be excluded 1 (for rotations) + 2 (for translations) + 2 (for scaling)
 + 1(for shearing) = 6 non-interesting parameter dimensions.
 Requiring that the curve be continuous, by using de Rham's continuity condition
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:continuity condition"

\end_inset

, eliminates two more degrees of freedom.
 This leaves behind a four-dimensional space of unique fractal curves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 A second dimension is explored with the

 curves, and a third with the Koch/Peano curves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general form may be narrowed as follows.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}$
\end_inset

 have the fixed point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 located at the origin 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)=(0,0)$
\end_inset

.
 This implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $a=d=0$
\end_inset

.
 Next let 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{1}$
\end_inset

 have the fixed point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)=(1,0)$
\end_inset

.
 This implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1-h$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m=-l$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, impose the de Rham condition for the continuity of the curve,
 namely that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}(p_{1})=d_{1}(p_{0})$
\end_inset

.
 This implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $h=b$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m=e$
\end_inset

.
 Changing symbols, the general form with the endpoints fixed may be written
 as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
d_{0}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}

\alpha & 1-\alpha & \zeta\\
\beta & -\beta & \eta\end{array}\right)\label{eq:general 3D de rham}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The half-way point of this curve is located at 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2=0.100\ldots=0.011\ldots=d_{1}d_{0}d_{0}\ldots=d_{0}d_{1}d_{1}\ldots$
\end_inset

 which can be seen to be 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)=(\alpha,\beta)$
\end_inset

.
 Using this last result to fix the location of the half-way point, what
 remains is a four-parameter family of linear planar fractal curves.
 Of this space, only about one-fourth the curves are

\begin_layout Subsection
The Family of Left-Right Symmetric Curves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of interest is the family of left-right symmetric curves.
 These are a subset of the above, and may be defined as follows: Given an
 expansion 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}^{a}d_{1}^{b}d_{0}^{c}\ldots$
\end_inset

 for the curve point 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)$
\end_inset

, one wants the mirrored expansion 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{1}^{a}d_{0}^{b}d_{1}^{c}\ldots$
\end_inset

 to go to the curve point 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-u,v)$
\end_inset

.
 Applying this to the half-way point of the curve, one may immediately deduce
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1/2$
\end_inset

.
 Applying this to the 
\begin_inset Formula $1/4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $3/4$
\end_inset

 points requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}d_{1}(p_{0})$
\end_inset

 be mirrored to 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{1}d_{0}(p_{1})$
\end_inset

, from whence one deduces that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\epsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=-\delta$
\end_inset

.
 Requiring additional symmetry at other points imposes no new constraints.
 Thus, the most general left-right symmetric plane curves generated by the
 three-dimensional representation are generated by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{0}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & \delta\\
0 & \beta & \epsilon\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and \;}d_{1}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & -\delta\\
\beta & -\beta & \epsilon\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 The Cesaro, Takagi and Koch curves may all be seen to be special cases
 of this form.
 It can furthermore be readily verified that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}=rd_{1}r$
\end_inset

, and so this family of left-right symmetric curves has a representation
 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Convergence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be clear that particularly large values of the parameters may
 lead to divergence upon iteration.
 To get absolute convergence, one wants the final form of the affine matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{x}=d_{b_{1}}\circ d_{b_{2}}\circ\cdots$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{x}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
u & 0 & 0\\
v & 0 & 0\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 so that the fixed point is 
\begin_inset Formula $(u,v)$
\end_inset

 independent of the starting point on the plane.
 In order to guarantee absolute convergence, it is clear that each of the
 two transforms should be contracting; this is guaranteed if the absolute
 value of each of the two eigenvalues of the two matrices
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha & \delta\\
\beta & \epsilon\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and }\;\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1-\alpha & \zeta\\
-\beta & \eta\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 are less than one.
 The eigenvalues are readily obtained, and the parameter space is bounded
 by eight quadratic surfaces.
 One may wonder if there is a region of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Section
Markov chains 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Markov chains are commonly studied in the theory of probability.
 Of all possible Markov chains, the chains for a stationary process are
 most frequently discussed, because they have a simple, tractable theory.
 In this section, we note that the de Rham construction can be used to create
 a set of non-stationary Markov chains that are none-the-less tractable.
 These are essentially a minor variant on the above construction, but are
 noted because of the importance of Markov chains in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Markov chain may be defined in several ways.
 For the purposes here, a Markov chain may be defined as a sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrices, the probability transition matrices, having the property that
 they preserve the norm of probability vectors.
 A probability vector is very simply a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $(p_{1},p_{2},\ldots,p_{n})$
\end_inset

 where all of the entries are real and positive, and sum to one.
 One may then deduce that the transition matrix must have entries that are
 real, and lie between zero and one, with the entries in each column summing
 to one as well.
 The sequence of matrices are multiplied together to form the chain.
 Properties of the chain that may be studied are expected value of the probabili
ty vector (the fixed point), the means-square variance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is readily seen that the general form of a two-dimensional dyadic chain
 will be 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
d_{0}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a & b\\
1-a & 1-b\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and }\; d_{1}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
c & d\\
1-c & 1-d\end{array}\right)\label{eq:Markov matrices}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The fixed point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{0}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{b}{1-a+b}\\
\frac{1-a}{1-a+b}\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Although there is not overt requirement for the resulting de Rham curve
 to be continuous, one might ask what constraints continuity imposes.
 The answer is that one must have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d=c-(1-a+b)\]

\end_inset

 The requirement that 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le d\le1$
\end_inset

 translates into the condition 
\begin_inset Formula \[
c+a\le1+b\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Section
Symbolic dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The construction and symmetry properties are not limited to continuous curves.
 Any system with a symbolic dynamics in two symbols is naturally parameterized
 through real numbers.
 Consider, for example, the symbolic dynamics of the tent map of unit height.
 By picking an initial value, and then iterating on the tent map, one will
 get a sequence of values.
 For each iteration, write down the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 if the value is less than 1/2, and write the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 if the value is more than 1/2.
 The result of the iteration will be an infinitely long string composed
 of the letters 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, sometimes called the 
\emph on
orbit
\emph default
 of the initial value.
 This string is the so-called symbolic dynamics of the iterated unit-height
 tent map.
 It can be shown that the symbolic dynamics of the iteration precisely and
 completely defines the iteration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is notable here is that any string in two letters can be exactly mapped
 to a real number, by interpreting it as the dyadic expansion of that number.
 In this case, let 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset

 be zero if the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th letter is 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, and let it be one if the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th letter is 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 We then define the value of a symbolic string to be 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
s(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c_{k}2^{-k}\label{eq:orbit value}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 was the initial value that was iterated.
 The figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

The graph of the values corresponding the orbit if an initial point, under
 iteration of the tent map.
 In fact, the orbits in this system are exactly solvable.
 If we expand the initial value as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}2^{-n}\]

\end_inset

 then the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset

 of equation

 are given by

\begin_inset Formula $k\ne0$
\end_inset

 and with 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}=b_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{k+1}(x)=\tau(2^{k}x)$

\begin_layout Description
Homework: Curiously, the representations of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 for the Takagi curve resemble the form that a translation would take in
 a linear projective space.
 That is, one has non-zero elements only along the diagonal, with the exception
 of the last row, whose non-zero elements can be interpreted as a translation
 in the given direction by a given amount.
 In other words, the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 look like affine transformations that encode a translation with a funny
 scale.
 By combining appropriately with 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, show how to encode a rotation, while minimizing the shear.

\begin_layout Description

\end_inset

 then look like an iterated affine transformation, reminiscent of the Barnsley
 IFS constructions
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 One can then take a set of arbitrary (contractive) group elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2},...\gamma_{k}\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

 and iterate on these, noting that they generate a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

 that consists of contractive affine transformations.
 The homework problem is then to repeat the Barnsley analysis on affine
 transformations, and to restate his 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 for these affine maps, this time, not for 2D images, but rather for an

Homework: Affine transformations imply a projective space.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
IFS Construction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The deRham construction is broadly applicable to pairs of iterated dyadic
 affine transformations, if one drops the requirement that the generated
 object be a continuous line.
 That is, given any pair of transforms 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{1}$
\end_inset

, one can label a string of iterations of these with a real number expressed
 in dyadic form.
 Such transformations, known as 
\emph on

\emph default
, include the

 dragon, the Harter-Heighway dragon, and a number of others, all of which
 are known to tile the plane.
 In essence, one associates to each map a measure; the sum of the measures
 reproduces the plane.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curiosity of this construction is that each measure can be broken down,
 in turn, but a labelling of the real number corresponding to the string
 of iterations.
 What remains to be shown is that these measures are not only self-similar,
 but that the semi-group of self-similarities is again the contracting semi-grou
p of the modular group.
 But, by its very construction, this demonstration is straightforward.

\begin_layout Subsection
Batrachions and Ladders of Symmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Batrachion is an integer sequence that hops from one integer to another
 using a simple recurrence relation.
 The Hofstadter-Conway 10,000-Dollar Sequence in particular is known to
 generate successive approximations to the Takagi Curve.
 That is, one has a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ladder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of approximations to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\tau\left(2^{k}x\right)\]

\end_inset

 by terminating the sum to a finite number of terms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Homework: Describe the set-theoretic implications of having a ladder of
 progressive symmetries on Batrachion sequences.
 That is, at each level, one can have more and more elements from the modular
 group come into play, expressing the symmetries available at that level.

 possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XXX This finite-to-infinite-limit inter-relation is essentially the same
 phenomenon as the relationship between binomial coefficients (Pascal's
 Triangle) and the Sierpinski Gasket, shown by Pietgen etal.
 The 10,000-Dollar Sequence is essentially the a sum over the modulo function
 on rows of binomial coefficients.
 In the limit, the projection of the Sierpinski Gasket onto the unit interval
 yields a multi-fractal measure whose integral is essentially the Takagi
 Curve.

 one can define 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}d\overrightarrow{v}/dx\equiv d\gamma\overrightarrow{v}/dx$

 for the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{v}=a+bx+ct_{w}(x)$

\end_inset

 as the rule for how the derivative transforms.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma'\neq\gamma_{1}$

\begin_layout Section
Analytic Continuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far, we have been looking at the Takagi curve as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x,$
\end_inset

 holding 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 fixed.
 One may also explore the dependency on 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 For any fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, the Takagi curve is analytic in 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, by construction, with radius of convergence of 1.
 One task is to describe the the set of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 for which the function may be analytically continued to values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|w\right|>1$
\end_inset

.
 There are many easy cases.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(0)=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(1/2)=1$
\end_inset

 are trivial, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(1/4)=w+1/2$
\end_inset

 is clearly entire.
 Continuing, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{1}{2^{n}}\right)=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\;\frac{1-2^{n}w^{n}}{1-2w}\]

\end_inset

 which is a polynomial of finite degree, without any poles (there is no
 pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $w=1/2$
\end_inset

), and thus entire.
 Its not hard to see, for any integer 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(p/2^{n})$
\end_inset

 will be a finite polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $w.$
\end_inset

 By contrast, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)=\frac{2}{3(1-w)}\]

\end_inset

 has a simple pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $w=1$
\end_inset

.
 Other values include 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)=\frac{2}{5}\cdot\frac{1+2w}{1-w^{2}}\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{1}{7}\right)=\frac{2}{7}\cdot\frac{1+2w+3w^{2}}{1-w^{3}}\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{1}{9}\right)=\frac{2}{9}\cdot\frac{1+2w+4w^{2}}{1-w^{3}}\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{1}{11}\right)=\frac{2}{11}\cdot\frac{1+2w+4w^{2}+6w^{3}+5w^{4}}{1-w^{5}}\]

\end_inset

 all of which appear to have simple poles at various roots of unity.
 Note that for all of these cases, the limiting asymptotic behavior for
 large 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is finite.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It could be interesting to provide a description in terms of the reduced
 characters.
 XXX do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given any one such value, one may deduce the related function using formula
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: power of two value"

\end_inset

 given previously:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{x}{2^{n}}\right)=\frac{x}{2^{n-1}}\left(\frac{1-2^{n}w^{n}}{1-2w}\right)+w^{n}t_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset

Thus, at least for many rational values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, it appears that the Takagi curve may be analytically extended to regions
 
\begin_inset Formula $|w|>1$
\end_inset

, where it appears to be a rational function of 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the rational numbers are a set of measure zero in the reals; can
 anything be done for the irrationals? Some numerical explorations can provide
 insight.

This figure shows a combined

 and

 portrait.
 Along the horizontal, 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\left|w\right|\exp i\theta$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|w\right|=0.94$
\end_inset

 fixed, and

 runs from 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 Along the vertical, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 running from 0 to 1.
 The color coding shows the arg, with black corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\rm arg}\, t_{w}\approx0$
\end_inset

, green to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\rm arg}\, t_{w}\approx\pi$
\end_inset

 and red to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\rm arg}\, t_{w}\approx2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 The dependency on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is not only discontinuous, but depends very much on how 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is sampled: choosing a vertical height of a prime number of pixels yields
 a different image than one where the eight is a composite number of small
 primes.
 In this case, a height of 
\begin_inset Formula $n=801$
\end_inset

 pixels was chosen.
 This value was chosen because the resulting samples are more representative
 of having 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 lie on true irrationals.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seeming general applicability of this mode of analysis seems to beg
 the question, are there any self-similar curves that do NOT have the modular
 group symmetry?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first, one is tempted to state that curves generated by 
\emph on
random
\emph default
 subdivision clearly cannot have this symmetry, but in fact, it is far from
 clear that this is true.
 As we've considered in an earlier chapter, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gaps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the continued fraction are 
\emph on
randomly
\emph default
 distributed on the unit square, and thus one has a Cauchy sequence that
 converges arbitrarily close to any given random value.
 The limit point is representable by a rational.
 This implies that 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 stochastic process on the unit interval can be represented by a strictly
 monotonically increasing sequence of rationals.
 This sequence of monotonically increasing rationals encodes the 'information'
 contained in the stochastic process, and through a standard 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta,\epsilon$
\end_inset

 type proof, can be shown to be made arbitrarily accurate.
 But because this sequence of rationals was constructed explicitly through
 the use of continued fractions, it has inherently built into it the symmetry
 of the Modular Group.
 That is, 
\emph on
even random walks
\emph default
 have the modular group symmetry.
 This symmetry is clearly hidden (perfectly hidden, one might say) when
 looking at the stochastic process itself, but should manifest itself whenever
 the stochastic process is used for some purpose.
 For example, in a differential equation, the symmetry will show up as a
 scaling property or a power-law noise spectrum.
 For a fractal constructed randomly, for example, thorough DLA (Diffusion
 Limited Aggregation), a similar set of scaling and self-similarity relationship
s will become manifest.
 In the case of DLA, the ability to analyze in terms of the equipotential,
 and to draw the Duoady-Hubbard rays that map the dendrites to the unit
 circle are already the strongest hint that the underlying symmetry group
 is the modular group.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gotcha
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is that the symmetry difficult to manifest in practice, since it requires
 identifying the rational associated with a particular dendritic shape,
 which is a computationally difficult proposition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A different example of this manifestation of symmetry in randomness is through
 the Barnsley IFS ideas.
 There, a suitably chosen set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 affine matrices can be used to generate a remarkably varied set of self-similar
 images, such as fern-leaf shapes, maple-leaf shapes, and cloud-shapes.
 A more general theorem due to Barnsley states that any two-dimensional
 image (photographic snapshot) can be encoded (represented) with a set of
 affine transformations.
 For a while, there was great excitement with the idea of fractal IFS image
 compression as file-format for encoding images for the Internet or for
 general use as a compression algorithm.
 There apparently do exist some reasonably efficient algorithms that can
 take a photograph, and given a desired degree of accuracy 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset

, extract the affine transformations that represent that photograph.
 By construction, the iterated affine transformations will be self-similar.
 But we saw above that any given set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

general, random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 affine matrices correspond one-to-one to a set of of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

general, random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (contractive) elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

.
 Through this exercise, we conclude that the self-symmetry of the Barnsley
 IFS fractals are in fact a manifestation of modular group symmetry, expressed
 through a choice of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 generators.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this exercise, one can now imagine that a suitably modified form of
 the Barnsley IFS image compression algorithm can be used to find the modular-gr
oup generators of the DLA fractals.
 To be precise, my intent is not merely to run snapshots of DLA through
 IFS, its rather to ask, what is the set of generators that will reproduce
 a given DLA tree, to a given accuracy? These generators then, by construction,
 correspond to elements of the modular group.
 One can then (potentially) create new theorems about DLA by picking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

randomly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the modular group, and exploring the consequences.
 This wouldn't be easy, but it would be interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pursuing the idea of symmetry in randomness in a different direction, its
 already known that stochastic differential equations have various scaling
 properties.
 We can now suspect that these scaling properties are the result of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hidden
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 self-similarity.
 Let us now chose some arbitrary but small set of generators from the modular
 group, and use these to generate a self-similar, but superficially stochastic,
 seemingly random process.
 How does the stochastic differential equation behave upon input of any
 such given stochastic-but-self-similar process? Can we decompose the equation
 into a summation of eigen-equations, each reacting in a specific way to
 a specific generator of the stochastic noise? Realistically, this would
 be a rather difficult research program.
 However, I find that the potential for doing this sort of analysis surprising
 and intriguing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Returning a bit closer to earth, we note the phase-locked regions of the
 Circle Map (see, for example, the pictures at the URL Circle Map 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.linas.org/art-gallery/basic/basic.html
\end_layout

\end_inset

) can be numbered with the Farey Numbers and are also qualitatively similar
 and suggestive of the gaps in continued fractions (see for example, the
 pictures at Farey Room Pictures 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.linas.org/art-gallery/farey/fthumb.html
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Reaching, but not too far, this implies that the Modular Group is the symmetry
 group of the Circle Map (the phase locked-loop of electronics) as well
 as the Mandelbrot Set.
 We then note that  the mode-locked regions of the circle map are exactly
 those regions that are *not* chaotic: in other words, these are the so-called
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of order
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that can be found in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sea of chaos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 One of course sees such islands in other iterated equations, such as the
 iterated Feigenbaum map, and one is naturally lead to ask, is the modular
 group the symmetry group that maps islands into islands, for any period
 doubling map? What about the converse? Are there any maps, with islands,
 that do not have the Modular Group as its underlying symmetry?
