\layout Abstract

The concept of self-similarity is central to the notion of a fractal, but
 the actual symmetry group that generates that self-similarity is oddly
 never named, and it seems fractals are never studied according to thier
 symmetries.
 Yet, in other branches of mathematics, it is well understood that symmetry
 provides a powerful mechanism for studying systems.
 Indeed, for dynamical systems, symmetries lead to conserved quantum numbers
 and/or conserved currents (via Noether's Theorm).
 
\layout Abstract

In this paper, we identify the symmetry group of period-doubling maps as
 being the Modular Group 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset 

.
 To anchor this assertion, we work out an explicit, exactly-solvable fractal
 curve, the Takagi or Blanncmange Curve, as transforming under the three-dimensi
onal representation of the Modular Group.
\layout Abstract

This paper is part of a set of chapters that explore the relationship between
 the real numbers, the modular group, and fractals.

Symmetries of Period-Doubling Maps
\layout Standard

It has been widely noticed that Farey Numbers appear naturally in the Mandelbrot
 Set.
 For example, here is a picture stolen from Robert L.
 Devaney's website 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[The Fractal Geometry of the Mandelbrot Set ]{}

\end_inset 

 :
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename farey-bud-numbers.gif

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This figure shows how to count the buds on the Mandelbrot set by assigning
 Farey Fractions to them.
 It is also widely known that Farey Numbers are deeply related to Continued
 Fractions: for example, Alexander Bogomolny's 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[Stern Brocot Trees]{http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Stern.shtml}

\end_inset 

 web page at Cut-the-Knot details this relationship.
 It is also well known that the natural way to compute with Continued Fractions
 are to use a dyadic representation, using the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula \[
L=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1\\
0 & 1\end{array}\right)\;\;\textrm{ and }\;\; R=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & 1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 to compute teh partial convergents of the continued fraction.
 It also well-known that these matrices generate the Modular Group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

.
 Yet I am personally not aware of any studies that make this complete chain
 of connections, and seriously explore fractal symmetries as an expression
 of the Modular Group.
 It is a deep mystery to me why books on modular forms never mention fractals,
 and books on fractals never mention modular forms.
 It just takes one whiff of the j-function, which is normally discussed
 only in books on modular forms, and constructed out of Jacobi Theta functions,
 to see jaw-dropping similarities between it and the Mandelbrot set, complete
 with prototype Pickover Stalks.
 The goal here is to take some baby steps to remedy this situation.
\layout Standard

In an earlier chapter, we have shown that an interesting subset of the Modular
 Group acts as a map of intervals to intervals, and can be enumerated as
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q\times\mathbb{N}}$
\end_inset 

 (that is, a subset of the Modular Group has a set-theoretic representation).
 In this chapter, we apply these ideas to a fractal curve studied by Weierstrass
 in 1872
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-5}

\end_inset 

, and further developed by Teiji Takagi in 1903, and by G.H.
 Hardy in 1916 and by others, now bearing the name Takagi Curve or Blancmange
 Curve.
 We show that this curve, and its assorted and related generalizations,
 transform under a three-dimensional representation of the Modular Group.
\layout Subsection

The Weierstrass-Takagi-Landsberg-Hardy Curve
\layout Standard

The Takagi-Landsberg curve was explored by Teiji Tagaki, circa 1903 as an
 example of a continuous-everywhere, differentiable-nowhere curve 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-3}

\end_inset 

.
 It is constructed by positive mid-point displacements of straight line
 segments, that is, by 'fractally' bumping a line segment upwards by an
 increasingly smaller displacement (xxxx we should diagram the standard
 Koch-Curve-like contruction here).
 Equivalently, one assigns geometrically smaller displacements to each level
 of the dyadic tree; that is, one picks some 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq w<1$
\end_inset 

, and assigns to each dyadic number 
\begin_inset Formula $x=p/2^{n}$
\end_inset 

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n>1$
\end_inset 

, the value 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{p}{2^{n}}\right)=w^{n-1}+\frac{1}{2}\left[t_{w}\left(\frac{p-1}{2^{n}}\right)+t_{w}\left(\frac{p+1}{2^{n}}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset 

 where we anchor the recurrance with 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(0)=t_{w}(1)=0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(1/2)=1$
\end_inset 

.
 One extends this curve to all reals by 'linear interpolation' between the
 dyadic values, as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\tau\left(2^{k}x\right)\]

\end_inset 

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the triangle function:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
2(x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor ) & \textrm{\; for \;} & 0\leq x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor <1/2\\
2(\left\lfloor x+1\right\rfloor -x) & \textrm{\; for \;} & 1>x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor \geq1/2\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

 Note that insofar as the triangle curve is differentiable, we could say
 that the Takagi curve is differentiable (along 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

) as well, in that it has both leftward-going and rightward-going derivatives,
 although these derivatives differ at each dyadic point.
 We can choose to define the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $dt_{w}/dx$
\end_inset 

 by passing the 
\begin_inset Formula $d/dx$
\end_inset 

 past the usmmation above, to act on the triangle-wave, to give a square
 wave.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1/4}(x)=4x(1-x)$
\end_inset 

 is a parabola (the mid-point subdivision construction of a parabola is
 attributed to Archimedes
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-3}

\end_inset 

).

This graph shows the Takagi-Landsberg curve 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(x)$
\end_inset 

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 for a fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $w=0.618$
\end_inset 

.
 The fractal self-similarity of this curve is readily appearent.
 
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

One can generalize this curve in a variety of ways, for example, by replacing
 the tent 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)$
\end_inset 

 with any 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

 on the unit interval.
 To get a continuous Takagi curve, one must have 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

 continuous and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(0)=f(1)$
\end_inset 

.
 Discontinuous functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

 yeild curves that are discontinuous everywhere: for example, the square
 wave 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)=d\tau/dx=1-2\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor $
\end_inset 

 gives the self-similar shape shown below.
 
\layout Standard

One also does not have to limit oneself to a power of two; Weierstrass considere
d 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}b^{k}\cos(a^{k}x\pi)\]

\end_inset 

 and Hardy showed that this function is differentiable nowhere provided
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $0<b<1$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a>1$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ab\geq1$
\end_inset 

.
 Despite 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset 

 not having the value of two, this function stiil appears to have basic
 fractal self-similarity, although it is not even about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset 

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset 

 is not an integer.
 
\layout Standard

Of the many possible different choices for 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

, the traingle wave is special in that it stays self-similar through iteration;
 that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tau\diamond\tau)(x)\equiv\tau^{2}(x)=\tau(2x)$
\end_inset 

 and generally, iterating on in 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

 times gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{k}(x)=\tau(2^{k}x)$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, we may write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\tau^{k}(x)\]

\end_inset

\layout Subsection

Symmetries of the Takagi Curve
\layout Standard

In this section, we will show that the Takagi curve transforms as a three-dimens
ional representation of the modular group.
 This provides an example where the action of the group can be precisely
 and completely specified.
 
\layout Standard

We recall from previous chapters that the modular group is generated by
 the interval contraction 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and the unit interval reflection 
\begin_inset Formula $r.$
\end_inset 

 We bear in mind that 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 are abstract group elements, and thus have distinct representations when
 acting on different sets.
 In the canonical representation of the modular group, these two generators
 would be 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{C}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & 1\end{array}\right)\;\;\textrm{ and }\;\; r_{C}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 1\\
0 & 1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 where we use the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset 

 to keep clear which representation we are working with.
 In terms of Mobius transforms, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{M}(x)=x/(1+x)$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{M}(x)=1-x$
\end_inset 

, which is why we call 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 the reflection.
 In the below, we will work with neither of these representations; instead,
 we will work with the dyadic representation, as developed in earlier chapters,
 and will discover the three-dimensional representation, which will be isomorphi
c to the dyadic representation.
 
\layout Standard

Consider first the generator that is the interval contraction 
\begin_inset Formula $g:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,1/2]$
\end_inset 

.
 It acts on the Takagi map as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[gt_{w}\right](x)=t_{w}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=x+wt_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 Iterating on this generator gives 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[g^{n}t_{w}\right](x)=t_{w}\left(\frac{x}{2^{n}}\right)=\frac{x}{2^{n-1}}\left(\frac{1-2^{n}w^{n}}{1-2w}\right)+w^{n}t_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 Next, we notice that the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 on the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $a+bx+ct_{w}(x)$
\end_inset 

 is both linear and is also closed, thus forming a vector space.
 That is, we have discovered that the Takagi Curve transforms under the
 three-dimensional represention of the modular group.
 To be explicit, we write a general element of the vector space as the dot-produ
ct of a row of real numbers times a column of basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula \[
a+bx+ct_{w}(x)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a & \; b & \; c\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
x\\
t_{w}(x)\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Then, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 have the representations 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0\\
0 & 1 & w\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and \;}r_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
1 & -1\; & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 where we use the subscript 3 to denote this is the 3-D representation.
 Under the action of this representation, 3-vectors transform as, for example,
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[gt_{w}\right](x)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & \;0 & \;1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1\; & 0\; & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0\\
0 & 1 & w\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
x\\
t_{w}(x)\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Previously, we had found the dyadic representation that acted on dyadic
 numbers as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2}\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and }\; r_{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & -1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 and so the 3D representation seems to be an extension of that vector space.
  The Takagi Curve is then seen to commute with the generators 
\begin_inset Formula $(g_{3}t_{w})(x)=(t_{w}g_{D})(x)$
\end_inset 

 and
\begin_inset Formula $(r_{3}t_{w})(x)=(t_{w}r_{D})(x)$
\end_inset 

 in this representation.
 
\layout Standard

For the sake of clarity, and to drive the point home, lets now examine the
 formulas for a contracting group element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}rg^{a_{3}}r...rg^{a_{N}}\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

.
 By 'contracting' we mean that we want to take all 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}\geq0$
\end_inset 

; as before, expanding and general group elements require us to compute
 intersections of the dyadic tree intervals, which proceeds as before but,
 as usual, complicates the language.
 We have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 acts on the real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 with the dyadic representation: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma:x=\gamma_{D}(x)=\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}}}-\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}}}+\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}}}-...+(-)^{N+1}\frac{x}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+...+a_{N}}}\]

\end_inset 

 which can be quickly computed by multiplying together the representation
 matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{D}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{D}$
\end_inset 

.
 By contrast, on the Takagi curve, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 acts as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{3}$
\end_inset 

, thus: 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}(\gamma_{D}(x))=\left[\gamma_{3}t_{w}\right](x)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & \;0 & \;1\end{array}\right)g_{3}^{a_{1}}r_{3}g_{3}^{a_{2}}r_{3}g_{3}^{a_{3}}r_{3}...r_{3}g_{3}^{a_{N}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
x\\
t_{w}(x)\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 which demonstrates the self-symmetry of the curve for arbitrary (contracting)
 element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Description

Caution: We've really only demonstrated an isomorphism for the contracting
 (and thier inverses, the expanding) group elements.
 General group elements usually map intervals that do not intersect with
 each other, and thus this isomorphism fails, or rather, becomes an isomorphism
 on the empty set.
 We should really provide a rigorous treatment for this.

\layout Standard

What have we done here? We have accomplished two things.
 First, we've demonstrated the explict symmetry relationship of the Takagi
 Curve.
 Next, we've found that the curve, together with 1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

, belong to the set of basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\{1,x,t_{w}\}$
\end_inset 

 of a three-dimensional representation of the modular group.
 The matrix representations of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 make it very easy to compute how the curve transforms under any given element
 of the modular group.
 
\layout Description

Corollary: The modular group is a symmetry group of the parabola, where
 the parabola is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1/4}(x)=4x(1-x)$
\end_inset 

 and we can trivially validate that 
\begin_inset Formula $(t_{1/4}\circ g)(x)=t_{1/4}(x/2)$
\end_inset 

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $(g\circ t_{1/4})(x)=x+t_{1/4}(x)/4$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Description

Theorm: Every real (or complex!) value of 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

 generates a unique, inequivalent representation of the modular group.
 
\layout Description

Proof: If two representations were equivalent, then we could find a matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{v}=U^{-1}g_{w}U$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $v\neq w$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r=U^{-1}rU$
\end_inset 

.
 We try to do this by brute force.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula \[
U=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c\\
d & e & f\\
k & l & m\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Equating 
\begin_inset Formula $rU=Ur$
\end_inset 

 we find immediately that 
\begin_inset Formula $l=b=0$
\end_inset 

.
 Next, equating 
\begin_inset Formula $Ug_{v}=g_{w}U$
\end_inset 

 one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $d=k=c=f=0$
\end_inset 

, leaving 
\begin_inset Formula $a=e=m$
\end_inset 

.
 But when 
\begin_inset Formula $v\neq w$
\end_inset 

 we find also that 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset 

, and so all elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

 vanish.
 There is no equivalency transformation between two different representations.

 line as set-theoretic expressions of functions on the binary tree.
 The uniqueness of the Takagi curve for each distinct value of

 That is, there is a large class of functions on the unit interval

\begin_inset Formula \[
f(x)=\int_{0}^{\infty}c(w)t_{w}(x)\; dw\]

 Describe the completeness, or rather, the lack-threof, of this function
 basis.
 Notice that already have one trivial example: for the parabola 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=4x(1-x)$
\end_inset 

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $c(w)=\delta(w-1/4)$

 The figure xxx shows one of these curves.
 It can be readily seen that the factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2l+1$
\end_inset 

, which is needed to enumerate the eigenfunctions, does not add any new
 or interesting complications to the overall symmetry.
 With a minimum of effort, one can quickly see that these curves transform
 under exactly the same representation as the Takagi Curve.
 Starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $g,$
\end_inset 

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[g\phi_{z,l}\right](x)=\phi_{z,l}(\frac{x}{2})=\exp\left((2l+1)\pi ix\right)+z\phi_{z,l}(x)\]

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

 one can define 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}d\overrightarrow{v}/dx\equiv d\gamma\overrightarrow{v}/dx$
\end_inset 

 for the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{v}=a+bx+ct_{w}(x)$
\end_inset 

 as the rule for how the 3-rep elements transform, and one can also define
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma't'_{w}(x)\equiv t'_{w}(\gamma x)$
\end_inset 

 as the rule for how the derivative transforms.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma'\neq\gamma_{1}$
\end_inset

Analytic Continuation
\layout Standard

So far, we have been looking at the Takagi curve as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x,$
\end_inset 

 holding 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

 fixed.
 We can also explore the converse.
 For any fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

, the Takagi Curve is analytic in 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(0)=0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(1/2)=1$
\end_inset 

 are trivial, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(1/4)=w+1/2$
\end_inset 

 is clearly entire.
 Continuing, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{1}{2^{n}}\right)=\frac{2}{2^{n}}\;\frac{1-2^{n}w^{n}}{1-2w}\]

\end_inset 

 which is a polynomial of finite degree, without any poles, and thus entire;
 indeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1/2}(2^{-n})=2^{1-n}n$
\end_inset 

.
 Its not hard to see, for any integer 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

, that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}(p/2^{n})$
\end_inset 

 will be a finite polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $w.$
\end_inset 

 By contrast, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)=\frac{2}{3(1-w)}\]

\end_inset 

 has a simple pole.
 Thus, on at least a pointwise basis, one may analytically extend the Takagi
 curve to regions 
\begin_inset Formula $|w|>1$
\end_inset 

.

 Yada Yada.
 The mode-locked regions are called Sinai's toungues.
 This implies that the Modular Group is the symmetry group of the phase
 locked-loop (the circle map) as well as the Mandelbrot Set.
 
\layout Standard

Notice that the mode-locked regions of the circle map are exactly those
 regions that are *not* chaotic: in other words, these are the so-called
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

islands of order
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 that can be found in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

sea of chaos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 One of course sees such islands in other iterated equations, such as the
 iterated Feigenbaum map, and one is naturally lead to ask, is the modular
 group the symmetry group that maps islands into islands, for any period
 doubling map? What about the converse? Are there any maps, with islands,
 that do not have the Modular Form symmetry? 
\layout Subsubsection

3-period Mode Locking
\layout Standard

Note that some chaotic maps are seen to have period-doubling paths to chaos
 that include a factor of three: viz.
 3,6,12,24,...
 I beleive that this should be considered a manifestation of the fact that
 the modular group can be written as the free product of the two and three
 cycles 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{3}$
\end_inset
