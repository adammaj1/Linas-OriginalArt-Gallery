\layout Abstract

This paper sketches a technique for improving the rate of convergence of
 a general oscillatory sequence, and then applies this series acceleration
 algorithm to the polylogarithm and the Hurwitz zeta function.
 As such, it may be taken as  an extension of the techniques given by Borwein's

\begin_inset Quotes erd

, to more general series.
 The algorithm provides a rapid means of evaluating 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)$
\end_inset 

 for general values of complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and the region of complex

 values given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z^{2}/(z-1)\right|<4$
\end_inset 

.
 This region includes the the Hurwitz zeta 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s,q)$
\end_inset 

 for general complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and real 
\begin_inset Formula $1/4\le q\le3/4$
\end_inset 

.
 By using the duplication formula, the range of convergence for the polylogarith
m may be extended to a kidney-shaped region in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane containing the unit circle surrounding the origin but excluding 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
 The Hurwitz zeta can be extended to the whole real interval 
\begin_inset Formula $0<q<1$
\end_inset 

.
 The speed of the algorithm is approximately linear in the number of operations
 required, although it does require the computation of integers raised to
 a complex power, which is generally a non-trivial and slow numerical operation.
 The primary, concrete result of this paper is an algorithm allows the explorati
on of the Hurwitz zeta in the critical strip, where fast algorithms are

Introduction
\layout Standard

This note sketches a technique for improving the rate of convergence of
 a general oscillatory series, and then applies this technique to the computatio
n of the polylogarithm, and, in particular, to the Hurwitz zeta function.
 It essentially generalizes an algorithm given by Peter Borwein for computing
 the Riemann zeta function.
 The principle result is an algorithm that efficiently obtains values of
 the Hurwitz zeta in the critical strip 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\sigma+i\tau$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\sigma\le1$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

The Hurwitz zeta function may be defined as 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s,q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+q)^{s}}\label{eq:Hurwitz zeta}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This series may be directly summed for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma>1$
\end_inset 

, although, for high-precision work, convergence is annoyingly slow unless
 one has at least 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\gtrsim2$
\end_inset 

.
 A globally convergent series was given by Helmut Hasse in 1930
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Has30}

\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s,q)=\frac{1}{s-1}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n+1}\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)(q+k)^{1-s}\label{eq:Hasse series}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Although technically convergent in the critical strip, in practice, the
 convergence is abysmally slow on the critical strip.
 Since the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis can be phrased in terms of the
 values of the Hurwitz zeta function on the critical strip, it is of some
 interest to have a fast algorithm for computing high-precision values of
 this function in this region.
 There seems to be a paucity of work in this area.
 There is a discussion of fast algorithms for Dirichlet L-functions in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Sle04}

\end_inset 

 (but this techniques seems to be limited in scope ????).
 
\layout Standard

The Hurwitz zeta may be expressed in terms of the polylogarithm: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n^{s}}\label{eq:polylog definition}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 by means of the identity 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)+\left(-1\right)^{s}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{-2\pi iq}\right)=\frac{\left(2\pi i\right)^{s}}{\Gamma(s)}\zeta(1-s,q)\label{eq:poly-hur relation}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 and so one might search for good algorithms for polylogarithms.
 Wood
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Wood92}

\end_inset 

 provides a extensive review of the means of computing the polylogarithm,
 but limits himself entirely to real values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 A recent survey
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Cra06}

\end_inset 

 indicates a similar paucity of genreral algorithms as well.
 The series defining the polylogarithm may be directly evaluated when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<1$
\end_inset 

, although direct evaluation becomes quite slow when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|\gtrsim0.95$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\lesssim2$
\end_inset 

.
 There do not seem to be any published algorithms that may be applied on
 the critical strip.
\layout Standard

The primary effort of this paper is to take the algorithm given by Borwein
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Bor95,Bor00-A}

\end_inset 

, which is a simple Padé-approximant type algorithm, and generalize it to
 the polylogarithm.
 The result is a relatively small finite sum that approximates the polylogarithm
, and whose error, or difference from the exact value can be precisely character
ized and bounded.
 Increased precision is easily obtainable by evaluating a slightly larger
 sum; one may obtain roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $2N$
\end_inset 

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $4N$
\end_inset 

 bits of precision by evaluating a sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 terms.
 The sum may be readily evaluated for just about any value 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 on the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 However, it is convergent only in a limited region of the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, and specifically, is only convergent when 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\frac{z^{2}}{z-1}\right|<4\]

\end_inset 

 This is sufficient for evaluating the Hurwitz zeta for general complex
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and real 
\begin_inset Formula $0<q<1$
\end_inset 

.
 Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any simple and efficient way
 of extending this result to the general complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, at least not for general values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The development of this paper proceeds as follows.
 First, a certain specific integral representation is given for the polylogarith
m.
 This representation is such that a certain trick, here called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

the Borwein trick
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, may be applied, to expressed the integral as a polynomial plus a small
 error term.
 This is followed by a sketch of a generalization of the trick to the convergenc
e acceleration of general oscillatory series.
 The next section selects a specific polynomial, and the error term of the
 resulting approximation is precisely bounded.
 This is followed by a brief review of the duplication formula for the Hurwitz
 zeta, and a short discussion of ways in which this numerical algorithm
 may be tested for correctness.
 The algorithm has been implemented by the author using the Gnu Multiple
 Precision arithmetic library
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{GMP}

\end_inset 

, and is available on request, under the terms of the LGPL license.
 The paper concludes with some intriguing images of the polylogarithm and
 the Hurwitz zeta function on the critical strip.
 
\layout Section

The Polylogarithm
\layout Standard

The polylogarithm has a non-trivial analytic structure.
 For fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, it has a branch cut on the positive real axis, for 
\begin_inset Formula $1<z<+\infty$
\end_inset 

.
 The location of the branch-point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

 is, as is always the case with branch points, the cause of limited convergence
 of analytic series in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 This is noted here, as this branch point has a direct impact on the algorithm,
 preventing convergence in its vicinity.
 The polylogarithm has many interesting properties, which are not reviewed
 here.
\layout Standard

The development of the algorithm requires the following integral representation.
\layout Lemma

The polylogarithm has the integral representation 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)=\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Proof

This identity is easily obtained by inserting the integral representation
 of the Gamma function:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z) & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n^{s}}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-u}u^{s-1}du\\
 & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}z^{n}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-nt}t^{s-1}dt\\
 & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{s-1}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(ze^{-t}\right)^{n}\, dt\\
 & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{s-1}\left[\frac{ze^{-t}}{1-ze^{-t}}\right]\, dt\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 and then finally substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $t=-\log y$
\end_inset 

 in the last integral.
 Although this derivation casually interchanges the order of integration
 and summation, one may appeal to general arguments about analytic continuation
 to argue that the final result is generally valid, provided one is careful
 to navigate about the branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Section

The Borwein trick
\layout Standard

The Borwein trick uses the integral form to find a simple, finite sum that
 approximates the desired value arbitrarily well.
 The trick consists of two steps.
 The first is to write the above integral in the form 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\xi(s,z) & = & \frac{1}{f(1/z)}\,\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{f(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\nonumber \\
 & = & \mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)+\frac{1}{f(1/z)}\,\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{f(y)-f(1/z)}{1-yz}\,\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}dy\label{eq:Borwein trick}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

 The second step is to find a sequence of polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 to be used for 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset 

, such that the integral on the right hand side can be evaluated as a simple,
 finite sum, while the left hand side can be shown to bounded arbitrarily
 close to zero as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset 

.
 The right hand side may be easily evaluated, by employing the following
 theorem.
\layout Theorem

Given a polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(y)$
\end_inset 

 of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, it can be shown that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
r_{n}(y)=\frac{p_{n}(y)-p_{n}(1/z)}{1-yz}\label{eq:r_n definition}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 is again a polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

, of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset 

, provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(1/z)\ne0$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Proof

Write the polynomial as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
p_{n}(y)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}y^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 while for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset 

 assume only a general series: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
r_{n}(y)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}c_{k}y^{k}\label{eq:r_n series}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset 

, one immediately obtains 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}=a_{0}-p_{n}(1/z)$
\end_inset 

.
 Higher coefficients are obtained by equating derivatives: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
r_{n}^{(k)}(y)=\frac{1}{1-yz}\left[p_{n}^{(k)}(y)+kzr_{n}^{(k-1)}(y)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}^{(k)}(y)$
\end_inset 

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

'th derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset 

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset 

 in the above, one obtains the recurrence relation 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}=a_{k}+zc_{k-1}$
\end_inset 

 which is trivially solvable as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
c_{k}=z^{k}\left[-p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)+\sum_{j=0}^{k}\frac{a_{j}}{z^{j}}\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 From this, it is easily seen that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}=0$
\end_inset 

 and more precisely 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n+m}=0$
\end_inset 

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ge0$
\end_inset 

.
 This concludes the proof that 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}(y)$
\end_inset 

 is a polynomial of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset 

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

This result may be immediately employed in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Borwein trick}

\end_inset 

 to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\xi(s,z)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)+\frac{z}{p_{n}(1/z)}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{c_{k}}{(k+1)^{s}}\label{eq:Polylog general estimate}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 To obtain a good approximation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset 

, one needs to find a polynomial sequence such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

 goes to zero as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset 

 for the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $(s,z)$
\end_inset 

 of interest.
 That is, one seeks to make 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\xi(s,z)=\frac{1}{p_{n}(1/z)}\,\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{p_{n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\label{eq:xi integral}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 as small as possible.
 One possible sequence, based on the Bernoulli process or Gaussian distribution,
 is explored in a subsequent section.
 
\layout Section

Convergence Acceleration of Oscillatory Series 
\layout Standard

For the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(y)=y^{n}$
\end_inset 

, the technique corresponds to Euler's method for the convergence acceleration
 of an alternating series
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[eqn 3.6.27]{A&S}

\end_inset 

; a particularly efficient algorithm for Euler's method is given by van
 Wijngaarden
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Pre88}

\end_inset 

.
 Polynomials that provide much more powerful series acceleration are discussed
 by Cohen 
\emph on 
etal
\emph default 

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Coh00}

\end_inset 

, but again in the context of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

; these include the Tchebysheff orthogonal polynomials considered by Borwien,
 which do a rather good job of minimizing the integrand of equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

.
 In a certain sense, an alternating series can be considred to be a series
 from which an explicit factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{n}$
\end_inset 

 has been factored out, for the very special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, one is lead to ask if one can find series acceleration methods for
 more general oscillatory series, where the oscillatory component can be
 thought of as going as 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{n}$
\end_inset 

 for some root of unity 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

The Euler method applied to the Hurwitz zeta function essentially leads
 to the Hasse series 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hasse series}

\end_inset 

.
 This may be seen by noting that the inner sum is just a forward difference:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)(q+k)^{1-s}=\triangle^{n}q^{1-s}\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle$
\end_inset 

 is the forward difference operator.
 The Hasse series has improved convergence in that the result is globally
 convergent, whereas the traditional series representation of equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz zeta}

\end_inset 

 is not.
 However, a quick numerical experiment will show that the Hasse series does
 not converge rapidly, especially in the critical strip.
\layout Standard

The poor convergence of these traditional techniques motivates the development
 of this paper.
 Strictly speaking, the slow convergence can be attributed to the fact that
 the naive series representations 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz zeta}

\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog definition}

\end_inset 

 are not strictly alternating series, as would be required to justify the
 application of the Euler method.
 Instead, the series are a superposition of oscillatory terms; for the polylogar
ithm, an explicit oscillation coming from 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{n}=\left|z\right|^{n}e^{in\arg z}$
\end_inset 

 and a slower oscillation coming from 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-s}=n^{-\sigma}e^{-i\tau\log n}$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, what one needs is a theory of sequence acceleration not for alternating
 series, but for oscillatory series.
 The polylogarithm approximation represents the 
\emph on 
ad-hoc
\emph default 
 development of a special case for such a general theory.
\layout Standard

A loose sketch of a possible general theory is presented below.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset 

 is some more or less arbitrary sequence of numbers, oscillatory in 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, and that one wishes to compute the sum 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}\]

\end_inset 

 but that one wants to apply convergence acceleration techniques to its
 evaluation.
 If the leading component of oscillation is 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}\sim\cos n\theta$
\end_inset 

, then one makes the ansatz that there must exist some dual series 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}$
\end_inset 

 oscillating as 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}\sim\sin n\theta$
\end_inset 

 to give 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{n}=c_{n}+is_{n}\sim e^{in\theta}$
\end_inset 

.
 One may then consider a sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}=e^{in(\pi-\theta)}e_{n}$
\end_inset 

 and consider the  summation of an alternating series 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(-1\right)^{n}a_{n}\]

\end_inset 

 By construction, the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are now presumed to be relatively tame, so that series acceleration techniques
 can be applied.
 This trick may be applied to any oscillatory sequence; one need not know
 a precise or 
\emph on 
a priori
\emph default 
 value for 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

; one need only guess at a reasonable value, based on the data at hand.
 
\layout Standard

Alternately, one may consider replacing the forward difference operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle b_{n}=b_{n+1}-b_{n}$
\end_inset 

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle_{q}b_{n}=b_{n+1}-qb_{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 Straightforward manipulations lead to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{z}{1-qz}\right)^{m+1}\triangle_{q}^{m}b_{0}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^{n}b_{n}\]

\end_inset 

 with the traditional Euler's series regained by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

.
 Assuming that the oscillatory part 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 is known, or can be approximately guessed at from the period of the oscillation
, then choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $q=-1/z$
\end_inset 

 should make the left hand side an accelerated series for the right hand
 side.
 However, there are more powerful techniques.
\layout Standard

Suppose one is interested in the sum
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^{n}b_{n}\label{eq: geo series}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 In general, one is interested in general sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 Suppose, however, that the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are expressible as moments, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b_{n}=\int_{0}^{1}y^{n}g(y)dy\]

\end_inset 

 for some function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)$
\end_inset 

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)$
\end_inset 

 is still fairly general (subject to constraints discussed below), this
 assumption does not overly restrict the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 If the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are expressible as moments, then one has
\begin_inset Formula \[
S(z)=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{g(y)}{1-yz}\, dy\]

\end_inset 

 Applying the Borwein trick, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S(z)=S_{n}(z)+\xi(z)\]

\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{n}(z)=\frac{1}{p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{p_{n}(y)-p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}{1-yz}g(y)\, dy\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\xi_{n}(z)=\frac{1}{p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{p_{n}(y)g(y)}{1-yz}\, dy\]

\end_inset 

 The goal is to show that the 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 are easily evaluated, while also showing tht the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 are arbitrarily small.
 The first is easy enough: using equations 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:r_n definition}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:r_n series}

\end_inset 

 one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{n}(z)=\frac{1}{p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}c_{k}b_{k}\]

\end_inset 

 With a suitable choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(z)$
\end_inset 

, the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset 

 are presumably easy to evaluate.
 To show that the 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 is really a series acceleration for the geometric series 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq: geo series}

\end_inset 

, one must show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\xi_{n}(z)\right|$
\end_inset 

 is bounded.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)\ge0$
\end_inset 

, then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\xi_{n}(z)\right|\le\left|\frac{p_{n}\left(y_{0}\right)}{p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}\right|\left|S(z)\right|\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{0}$
\end_inset 

 is the point on the unit interval where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(y)$
\end_inset 

 assumes its maximum.
 Provided that one can find a polynomial sequence such that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\frac{p_{n}\left(y_{0}\right)}{p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}\right|\sim A^{-n}\]

\end_inset 

 for some number 
\begin_inset Formula $A>\left|1/z\right|$
\end_inset 

, then one has that the series 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}(z)$

Note that the above is a proof of a series acceleration method for a more-or-les
s general sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

, and is in no way particular to the polylogarithm or the Hurwitz zeta.
 The only ingredients of the proof were that the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

well-behaved
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 -- in this case, being expressible as moments of a rather general function
 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)$
\end_inset 

.
 For the proof to hold, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)$
\end_inset 

 needs to be (mostly) positive, and integrable; it need not be analytic,
 differentiable or even continuous.
 It needs to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

mostly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 positive only so that the bound on the integrand, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(y)g(y)\le\left|p_{n}\left(y_{0}\right)\right|g(y)$
\end_inset 

 can be established.
 Thus, one might hope that the acceleration method might work, even for
 those general cases where 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)$
\end_inset 

 is not explicitly known, but the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are somehow

 The generalization of those results to arbitrary

There is another, possibly fruitful direction one might take.
 This hinges on noting that the integrands above take the general form of
 a Padé approximation, and one proceeds from there.

The Gaussian Distribution 
\layout Standard

Returning to the polylogarithm, the task at hand is to find a polynomial
 sequence that is suitable for establishing a tight bound on the error term
 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

.
 A good bound minimizes the integrand, while also maximizing the value of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p_{n}(1/z)\right|$
\end_inset 

.
 In order to suppress the logarithmic branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset 

 in the integrand of 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

, this section will consider the polynomial sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(y)=y^{a}(1-y)^{n-a}$
\end_inset 

, a sequence which goes over to the Gaussian distrubution for large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

Consider first the polynomial sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2n}(y)=y^{n}(1-y)^{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 It becomes sharply peaked at 
\begin_inset Formula $y=1/2$
\end_inset 

, and subtends a diminishingly small area.
 For large values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, this polynomial sequence approximates a Gaussian:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
p_{2n}(y)=\frac{1}{4^{n}}e^{-4n(y-1/2)^{2}}\left[1+2\left(y-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(\left(y-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{4}\right)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Using this in the integral 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

, and assuming that the real part of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 is not positive, it is not hard to deduce the very crude estimate
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\xi(s,z)\sim\left(\frac{z^{2}}{4(z-1)}\right)^{n}\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which confirms that 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(s,z)$
\end_inset 

 does indeed get suitably small for a certain region in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 However, in order for equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Polylog general estimate}

\end_inset 

 to be useful computationally, an upper bound on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

 needs to be given, as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

.
 This bound is derived in the next section.
 
\layout Standard

The polynomial coefficients are easily obtained, and are 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
a_{0} & = & a_{1}=\cdots=a_{n-1}=0\\
a_{n+k} & = & \left(-1\right)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\quad\mbox{ for }0\le k\le n\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 This leads to 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)=-\frac{z^{2n+1}}{\left(z-1\right)^{n}}\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1}\frac{c_{k}}{\left(k+1\right)^{s}}+\xi(s,z)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset 

 are given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
c_{k}=z^{k}\left[-\left(\frac{z-1}{z^{2}}\right)^{n}+\frac{1}{z^{n}}\sum_{j=0}^{k-n}\left(-1\right)^{j}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
j\end{array}\right)\frac{1}{z^{j}}\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where the summation above is to be understood to be zero when 
\begin_inset Formula $k<n$
\end_inset 

.
 The above summations can be re-organized into the more suggestive form
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{z^{k}}{k^{s}}\;+\frac{1}{\left(1-z\right)^{n}}\;\sum_{k=n+1}^{2n}\frac{z^{k}}{k^{s}}\;\sum_{j=0}^{2n-k}\left(-z\right)^{j}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
j\end{array}\right)+\xi(s,z)\label{eq:polylog specific estimate}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 The error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(s,z)$
\end_inset 

 is negligible for only a very specific area of the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 The region where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

 may be ignored as a small error is derived in the next section.
 Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

 in the above formulas agrees with expressions previously given by Borwein

Bound on the Error Term
\layout Standard

In order for equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 to be useful computationally, an upper bound on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 needs to be given.
 To compute the polylogarithm to some desired precision, one infers a suitable
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 based on this bound.
 However, to acheive this desired precision, one must not only choose 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 large enough, but one must also maintain a somewhat larger number of digits
 in the intermediate terms, as the appearance of the binomial coefficient
 in the equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 implies that intermediate terms can become quite large, even while mostly
 cancelling.
 This section derives an upper bound on the size of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

, and breifly discusses the issue of the required precision in intermediate
 terms.
 
\layout Standard

The general behaviour of the integrand appearing in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

 depends on the whether 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s\ge1$
\end_inset 

 or not; estimates are presented for these two cases.
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\sigma+i\tau$
\end_inset 

 for real 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

, and assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\ge1$
\end_inset 

 and choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\le n$
\end_inset 

, one has
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\left|p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}\right| & \le & p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{\sigma-1}\label{eq:}\\
 & = & \left|y(1-y)\log y\right|^{\sigma-1}\left(y(1-y)\right)^{n-\sigma+1}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

 Each part of the right hand side is bounded by a Gaussian, and since the
 product of Gaussians is a Gaussian, so is the entire expression.
 From the Stirling approximation, one has the well-known identity 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(y(1-y)\right)^{a}\le\frac{1}{4^{a}}\exp-4a\left(y-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}\]

\end_inset 

 The other part is also bounded by a Gaussian 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|y(1-y)\log y\right|^{a}\le\left|y_{0}\left(1-y_{0}\right)\log y_{0}\right|^{a}\exp\left(-\frac{a\left(y-y_{0}\right)^{2}}{2y_{0}\left(1-2y_{0}\right)}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 which is centered on the maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|y_{0}\left(1-y_{0}\right)\log y_{0}\right|$
\end_inset 

, that is, at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{0}=0.23561058253\ldots$
\end_inset 

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{0}$
\end_inset 

 is the solution to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\frac{d}{dy}\; y(1-y)\left|\log y\right|\]

\end_inset 

 Curiously, the numerical value of the factor in the Gaussian is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2y_{0}(1-2y_{0})=4.013295587\ldots$
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

To evaluate the integral in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

, one also needs a bound on the denominator.
 This is furnished by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\frac{1}{1-yz}\right|\le C(z)=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{ if }\Re z\le0\\
\frac{1}{\left|1-z\right|} & \mbox{ if }0<\Re z\;\mbox{ and }\left|z\right|<1\\
\left|\frac{z}{\Im z}\right| & \mbox{ if }0<\Re z\;\mbox{ and }\left|z\right|>1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset 

 Thus, the integrand is bounded by a Gaussian.
 Multiplying the two Gaussians, completing the square, and evaluating the
 resulting integral is a bit tedious.
 The result is that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\right|\le C(z)\frac{\left|4y_{0}\left(1-y_{0}\right)\log y_{0}\right|^{\sigma-1}}{4^{n}}\, G(s)\]

\end_inset 

 The constant may be taken as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|4y_{0}\left(1-y_{0}\right)\log y_{0}\right|=1.041381965\ldots$
\end_inset 

.
 The factor 
\begin_inset Formula $G(s)$
\end_inset 

 is bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
G(s) & \le & \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{4n}}\exp-\left(1-2y_{0}\right)^{2}\left(\sigma-1\right)\frac{8y_{0}\left(1-2y_{0}\right)}{8y_{0}\left(1-2y_{0}\right)+\frac{\sigma-1}{n-\sigma+1}}\\
 & \le & \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{4n}}\exp-\left(1-2y_{0}\right)^{2}\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}\\
 & \le & 1\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le\sigma$
\end_inset 

.
 Useful for estimation is that 
\begin_inset Formula $8y_{0}(1-2y_{0})=0.996687115\ldots$
\end_inset 

.
 Combining these results, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left|\xi(s,z)\right|\le\frac{1}{4^{n}}\left|\frac{z^{2}}{z-1}\right|^{n}\left|\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\right|C(z)G(s)\left(1.0414\ldots\right)^{\sigma-1}\label{eq:error-bound-positive}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 for the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le\sigma$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 choosen so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\le n$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\le1$
\end_inset 

 may be evaluated as follows.
 One writes 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left|p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}\right| & \le & p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{\sigma-1}\\
 & = & \left|\frac{1-y}{\log y}\right|^{1-\sigma}y^{n}(1-y)^{n+\sigma-1}\\
 & \le & y^{n}(1-y)^{n+\sigma-1}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 The integrand may now be recognized as the Beta function, so that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\right|\le C(z)\frac{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(n+\sigma)}{\Gamma(2n+\sigma+1)}\]

\end_inset 

 In the region where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|\ll n$
\end_inset 

, one may approximate 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(n+\sigma)}{\Gamma(2n+\sigma+1)}\le\frac{2^{1-\sigma}}{4^{n}}\]

\end_inset 

 Combining the various pieces, one obtains a result remarkably similar to
 the previous one; namely, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\le1$
\end_inset 

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|\ll n$
\end_inset 

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left|\xi(s,z)\right|\le\frac{1}{4^{n}}\left|\frac{z^{2}}{z-1}\right|^{n}\left|\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\right|2^{1-\sigma}C(z)\label{eq:error-bound-negative}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

For evaluations on the critical line 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=1/2$
\end_inset 

, one needs a good estimate for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Gamma(s)\right|^{-1}$
\end_inset 

, which can become quite large as the imaginarypart of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 increases.
 A useful estimate for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Gamma(s)\right|^{-1}$
\end_inset 

 is given by Borwein 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Bor00-A,Bor95}

\end_inset 

, for the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\ge-m+1/2$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{\left|\Gamma(s)\right|} & = & \frac{1}{\left|\Gamma(\sigma)\right|}\sqrt{\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(1+\frac{\tau^{2}}{\left(\sigma+k\right)^{2}}\right)}\\
 & \le & \frac{1}{\left|\Gamma(\sigma)\right|}\sqrt{\frac{\sinh\tau\pi}{\tau\pi}\,\prod_{k=0}^{m}\left(1+\frac{\tau^{2}}{\left(\frac{1}{2}+k\right)^{2}}\right)}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 
\layout Standard

A remarkable side-effect of the estimation is that, for 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 equal to negative integers, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(s)$
\end_inset 

 is infinite, thus implying that the error term is zero.
 This somewhat surprising result corresponds to the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{-n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 has an exact expression as a ratio of two polynomials, the denominator
 being of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset 

.
 Indeed, setting 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset 

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset 

 into equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 gives the exact result 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Li}_{0}(z)=\frac{z}{1-z}\]

\end_inset 

 while for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=-1$
\end_inset 

, one must use 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset 

, to obtain the exact result
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Li}_{-1}(z)=\frac{z}{\left(1-z\right)^{2}}\]

\end_inset 

 The generic form for the polylogarithm at the negative integers is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Li}_{-n}(z)=\left(-1\right)^{n}\,\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(-1\right)^{k}\frac{k!}{\left(1-z\right)^{k+1}}\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
n+1\\
k+1\end{array}\right\} \]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right\} $
\end_inset 

 denotes the Stirling numbers of the second kind.
\layout Standard

In general, the formula 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 seems to have the curious property of always evaluating to exactly the
 same rational function whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is a non-positive integer, and 
\begin_inset Formula $-s<n$
\end_inset 

.
 That is, for fixed non-positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, the sum is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 is large enough.
 Thus, this polynomial approximation has the pleasing result of giving exact
 answers in the case when an exact polynomial answer is possible.
\layout Standard

For the general case, one may conclude that the estimate 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 can be effectively applied whenever
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\frac{z^{2}}{z-1}\right|<4\]

\end_inset 

 To obtain a value of the polylogarithm to within some given numerical precision
, one must invert the formulas 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:error-bound-positive}

\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:error-bound-negative}

\end_inset 

, solving for the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 which is to be used in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

.
 To obtain a fixed number of digits of precision, one must carry out intermediat
e calculations with at least that many digits of precision.
 In fact, one must have more.
 The appearence of the binomial coefficient in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 is the problem.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n}>\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
j\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset 

, one concludes that 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 additional binary bits of precision are needed with which to carry out
 the calculations.
 As a result, it becomes difficult to implement the algorithm robustly using
 only double-precision arithmetic.
 For values of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

, the algorithm is well-enough behaved; however, round-off errors significantly
 disturb the calculations as 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset 

.
 This trouble with precision can be at least partly alleviated by making
 use of the duplication formula, as discussed in the next section.
\layout Section

Duplication formula
\layout Standard

The region of applicability of the algorithm may be exteneded by making
 use of the duplication formula for the polylogarithm or periodic zeta.
 The duplication formula, or more generally, the multiplication theorem,
 is an extension of the well-known Legendre duplication formula for the
 Gamma function
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[(6.1.18),(6.3.8)(23.1.10)]{A&S}

\end_inset 

, into the domain of the polylogarithm.
\layout Standard

Thus, for example, the formula 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 together with the error bounds 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:error-bound-positive}

\end_inset 

,
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:error-bound-negative}

\end_inset 

 allow 
\begin_inset Formula $F(s;q)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)$
\end_inset 

 to be computed for real 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 in region 
\begin_inset Formula $1/4\le q\le3/4$
\end_inset 

.
 To obtain values on the region 
\begin_inset Formula $0<q<1/4$
\end_inset 

, one applies the duplication formula 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F\left(s;q\right)=2^{1-s}F\left(s;2q\right)-F\left(s;q+\frac{1}{2}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 recursively until one obtains values of 
\begin_inset Formula $q\ge1/4$
\end_inset 

.
 Rearranging terms, one obtains a similar formula for iterating values of
 
\begin_inset Formula $q>3/4$
\end_inset 

 until they are less than or equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $3/4$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, as 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 approaches 0 or 1, the algorithm requires more time, but only logarithmically
 so, as 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}q$
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}(1-q)$
\end_inset 

 as the case may be.
\layout Standard

The duplication formula follows from a general 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

-adic identity 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{m=0}^{p-1}F\left(s;\frac{m+q}{p}\right)=p^{1-s}F\left(s;q\right)\]

\end_inset 

 which is valid for any positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

.
 This formula may be obtained by noting that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $F\left(s;q\right)$
\end_inset 

 is an eigenvalue of the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

-adic Bernoulli transfer operator associated with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{1-s}$
\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Ve-B04}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The equivalent formulas for the polylogarithm are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)+\mbox{Li}_{s}(-z)=2^{1-s}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z^{2}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

-adic version has the appearance of a Gauss sum:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{m=0}^{p-1}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(ze^{2\pi im/p}\right)=p^{1-s}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z^{p}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 
\layout Standard

The repeated application of the duplication formula is crucial for the extension
 of the algorithm to points that get near 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

; indeed, one can get arbitrarily close to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

 in this way.
 A more general application of the duplication formula, to extend the algorithm
 to the entire complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, is stymied by the fact that the algorithm uttterly fails near the
 branch cut.
 One may make some progress by moving values away from the branch cut with
 the relation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e^{-i\pi2/s}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)+e^{i\pi s/2}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)=\frac{\left(2\pi\right)^{s}}{\Gamma(s)}\zeta\left(1-s,\frac{\log z}{2\pi i}\right)\]

\end_inset 

However, this presumes that one has some independent means of computing
 the Hurwitz zeta.
 The Hurwitz zeta 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s,q)$
\end_inset 

 may be summed directly for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\gtrsim2$
\end_inset 

 but is not easily calculable in other regions; indeed, the point of this
 paper is to compute the Hurwitz zeta by employing the above relation.

Validation
\layout Standard

The correctness of a given numerical implementation can be validated in
 a number of ways.
 For non-positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, one has the exact rational functions previously mentioned.
 For positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, one has the relationship 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{n}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)+\left(-1\right)^{n}\mbox{Li}_{n}\left(e^{-2\pi iq}\right)=-\frac{\left(2\pi i\right)^{n}}{n!}B_{n}(q)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}(x)$
\end_inset 

 are the Bernoulli polynomials.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

, one regains the Riemann zeta function 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s)$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(-1\right)=\frac{1}{2^{1-s}-1}\,\zeta(s)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 For 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<1$
\end_inset 

, the defining series 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog definition}

\end_inset 

 is explicitly convergent, and may be directly summed, thus offering a fourth
 check of the correctness of an implementation.
 Finally, the multiplication theorem can be used to check for consistency.

The

\end_inset 

Periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Zeta Function
\layout Standard

The ability to compute the polylogarithm allows one to visualize some of
 the interesting sums that occur in number theory.
 One such example is the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

periodic zeta function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, defined by Apostol
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[Thm 12.6]{Apo76}

\end_inset 

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F(q,s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{i2\pi nq}}{n^{s}}\label{eq:periodic zeta}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Clearly, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $F(q,s)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 The periodic zeta function occurs when one attempts to state a reflection
 formula for the Hurwitz zeta function, as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(1-s,q)=\frac{\Gamma(s)}{(2\pi)^{s}}\left[e^{-i\pi s/2}F(q,s)+e^{i\pi s/2}F(1-q,s)\right]\label{eq:Hurwitz reflection}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 What makes the periodic zeta function interesting is that 
\emph on 
it is not actually periodic
\emph default 
.
 That one might think it is seems obvious from the definition 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:periodic zeta}

\end_inset 

: the direct substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to q+1$
\end_inset 

 gives the false suggestion of periodicity in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

.
 This is false because, in fact, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset 

 has a branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 zeta function is multi-sheeted, and, attempting to trace a continuous path
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to q+1$
\end_inset 

, while keeping 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 real carries one through the branch-point, and from one sheet to the next.
 This may be illustrated in several ways; first, graphically, in figures
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Periodic-zeta-function}

\end_inset 

 and x.

This graph shows the real and imaginary parts of the periodic zeta function
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F(q,s)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\frac{1}{2}+i25$
\end_inset 

.
 This value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is close to a zero of the Riemann zeta function, at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\frac{1}{2}+i25.01085758014\ldots$
\end_inset 

 Thus, both the real and imaginary parts approach zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset 

, as well as at 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 The increasing oscillations as 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

 are due to the contribution of the very first term of the Hurwitz zeta:
 that is, these oscillations are nothing other than that of 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{-s}=e^{i25\log q}/\sqrt{q}$
\end_inset 

.
 Subtracting these away is the same as analytically continuing to the region
 
\begin_inset Formula $q>1$
\end_inset 

, and matches the coarser set of oscillations, which are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $(1+q)^{-s}=e^{i25\log(1+q)}/\sqrt{1+q}$
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Noteworthy is that the presumed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

periodicity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 is very misleading: the image suggests an essential singularity at 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0$
\end_inset 

, and continuing, logarithmically slower oscillatory behaviour for the analytic
 continuation to the region where 
\begin_inset Formula $q>1$
\end_inset 

.
\end_inset 

 
\layout Standard

The first figure, 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Periodic-zeta-function}

\end_inset 

, shows an oscillatory behaviour that clearly diverges as 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

.
 This oscillation is can be simply explained.
 Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\frac{1}{2}+i\tau$
\end_inset 

 into equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz reflection}

\end_inset 

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}-i\tau,\, q\right)=\frac{e^{-i\pi/4}e^{-i\tau\log2\pi}e^{i\phi}}{\sqrt{2\cosh\tau\pi}}\left[e^{\pi\tau/2}F(q,s)+ie^{-\pi\tau/2}F(1-q,s)\right]\]

\end_inset 

 after the substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+i\tau\right)=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}e^{i\phi}}{\sqrt{\cosh\tau\pi}}\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset 

 is a purely real phase that can be expressed as a somewhat complicated
 sum
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[eqn 6.1.27]{A&S}

\end_inset 

.
 For reasonably large, positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=25$
\end_inset 

 in the picture, one may ignore the second term, so that the whole expression
 simplifies to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F\left(\frac{1}{2}+i\tau,\, q\right)=\exp\, i\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\phi+\tau\log2\pi\right)\;\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}-i\tau,\, q\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(C^{-\tau}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 for some real constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C>0$
\end_inset 

.
 Then, as 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

, the leading contribution to the Hurwitz zeta comes from the 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0$
\end_inset 

 term in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz zeta}

\end_inset 

: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{-s}=e^{i\tau\log q}/\sqrt{q}$
\end_inset 

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F\left(\frac{1}{2}+i\tau,\, q\right)\approx\frac{e^{i\tau\log q}e^{i\psi}}{\sqrt{q}}\;\mbox{ as }q\to0\label{eq:F-approx}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 for some fixed, real phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset 

 that is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

.
 As is eminently clear from both the picture 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Periodic-zeta-function}

\end_inset 

, and from the approximation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:F-approx}

\end_inset 

, the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $F(q,s)$
\end_inset 

 cannot be taken: this is the branch-point of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset 

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

Curiously, the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to1$
\end_inset 

 does exist, and one has 
\begin_inset Formula $F(1,s)=\zeta(s)$
\end_inset 

 the Riemann zeta.
 The approximation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:F-approx}

\end_inset 

 hints at how to move through the branch point, from one sheet to the next:
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:F-approx}

\end_inset 

 is the discontinuity between sheets.
 That is, one has, for large, positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
F\left(\frac{1}{2}+i\tau,\, q+1\right)\approx F\left(\frac{1}{2}+i\tau,\, q\right)-\frac{e^{i\tau\log q}e^{i\psi}}{\sqrt{q}}\]

\end_inset 

 as the formula that approximates the movement from one sheet to the next.
 In essence, this shows that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 zeta function is not at all periodic: 
\begin_inset Formula $F(s,q+1)\ne F(s,q)$
\end_inset 

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s\le1$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

The complete relationship between the Hurwitz zeta and the periodic zeta
 is rather subtle.
 For example, if instead one considers large 
\emph on 
negative
\emph default 
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

, and graphs the periodic zeta, one obtains what is essentially the left-right
 reversed image of 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Periodic-zeta-function}

\end_inset 

, with oscillations approaching a singularity at 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to1$
\end_inset 

.
 One may easily 
\emph on 
numerically
\emph default 
 verify that these oscillations are precisely of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-q)^{-s}$
\end_inset 

.
 From this, one may deduce that the correct form of the reflection formula
 is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F(q,1-s)=\frac{\Gamma(s)}{(2\pi)^{s}}\left[e^{i\pi s/2}\zeta(s,q)+e^{-i\pi s/2}\zeta(s,1-q)\right]\label{eq:periodic reflection}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which captures the oscillatory behaviour at 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

 for large positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 and the oscillations at 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to1$
\end_inset 

 for large negative 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

.
 The precise form of the discontinuity across the branch point, that would
 be valid for small positive or negative 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

, is not at all clear.

Conclusion
\layout Standard

The updated algorithm apears to offer a stable and fast way of computing
 the Hurwitz zeta function for general complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and real 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

.
 It allows the polylogarithm to be computed over an extended range as well.
 An actual implementation using a variable-precision library shows that
 the algorithm is quite tractable.
 
\layout Standard

An unexplored area is the optimal implementation of the algorithm using
 standard IEEE double-precision floating-point mathematics.
 Preliminary work shows that some of the intermediate terms are just large
 enough so that rounding error may be of concern; the region of high-precision
 convergence has not been characterized.
 The propagation of rounding erors through the algorithm has not been characteri
zed; it may be possible to re-arrange terms to minimize the propagation
 of errors.
 Such a characterization is necessary before reliable double-precision code
 can be created.
 By contrast, such considerations can be swept under the carpet when employing
 arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
\layout Standard

Evaluating the bounds 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:error-bound-positive}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:error-bound-negative}

\end_inset 

, so as to obtain an order estimate, is non-trivial, and can account for
 a significant amount of compute time.
 A speedier heuristic is desirable.
\layout Standard

It may be possible to find even more repidly converging algorithms, by generaliz
ing some of the results from Cohen 
\emph on 
et al
\emph default 

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Coh00}

\end_inset 

, or by appealing to the general theory of Padé approximants.
 Both approaches seem promising, although that of Padé approximants may
 yeild a more general theory.
\layout Standard

Another peculiar corner of of the theory of special functions is the characteriz
ation of the periodic zeta function.
 The discontinuity across the branch cut of the periodic zeta is unclear;
 it should be carefully characterized in relation to the branch cuts of
 the polylogarithm and the Hurwitz zeta.
\layout Standard

This paper concludes with the application of the algorithm to render some
 pretty images.

 Zeroes of the Riemann zeta function
