Introduction
\layout Standard

This note generalizes an algorithm given by Peter Borwein for computing
 the Riemann zeta function, to the computation of the polylogarithm and,
 in particular, to the Hurwitz zeta function.
 The principle result is an algorithm that efficiently obtains values of
 the Hurwitz zeta in the critical strip 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\sigma+i\tau$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\sigma\le1$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

The Hurwitz zeta function may be defined as 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s,q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+q)^{s}}\label{eq:Hurwitz zeta}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This series may be directly summed for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma>1$
\end_inset 

, although, for high-precision work, convergence is annoyingly slow unless
 one has at least 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\gtrsim2$
\end_inset 

.
 A globally convergent series was given by Helmut Hasse in 1930
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Has30}

\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(s,q)=\frac{1}{s-1}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n+1}\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)(q+k)^{1-s}\]

\end_inset 

 Although technically convergent in the critical strip, in practice, the
 convergence is abysmally slow on the critical strip.
 Since the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis can be phrased in terms of the
 values of the Hurwitz zeta function on the critical strip, it is of some
 interest to have a fast algorithm for computing high-precision values of
 this function in this region.
 There seems to be a paucity of work in this area.
 There is a discussion of fast algorithms for Dirichlet L-functions in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Sle04}

\end_inset 

 (but this techniques seems to be limited in scope ????).
 
\layout Standard

The Hurwitz zeta may be expressed in terms of the polylogarithm: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n^{s}}\label{eq:polylog definition}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 by means of the identity 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)+\left(-1\right)^{s}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{-2\pi iq}\right)=\frac{\left(2\pi i\right)^{s}}{\Gamma(s)}\zeta(1-s,q)\label{eq:poly-hur relation}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 and so one might hope for some efficient algorithms in that area.
 Wood
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Wood92}

\end_inset 

 provides a extensive review of the means of computing the polylogarithm,
 but limits himself entirely to real values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 A recent survey
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Cra06}

\end_inset 

 indicates a similar paucity as well.
 The series defining the polylogarithm may be directly evaluated when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<1$
\end_inset 

, although direct evaluation becomes quite slow when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|\gtrsim0.95$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\lesssim2$
\end_inset 

.
 There do not appear to be any general algorithms that may be applied on
 the critical strip.
\layout Standard

The primary effort of this paper is to take the algorithm given by Borwein
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Bor95,Bor00-A}

\end_inset 

, and generalize it to the polylogarithm.
 The result is a relatively small finite sum that approximates the polylogarithm
, and whose error, or difference from the exact value can be precisely character
ized and bounded.
 Increased precision is easily obtainable by evaluating a slightly larger
 sum; one may obtain roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $2N$
\end_inset 

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $4N$
\end_inset 

 bits of precision by evaluating a sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 terms.
 The sum may be readily evaluated for just about any value 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 on the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 However, it is convergent only in a limited region of the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, and specifically, is only convergent when 
\begin_inset Formula \[
0.261\left|\frac{z^{2}}{z-1}\right|<1\]

\end_inset 

 This is sufficient for evaluating the Hurwitz zeta for general complex
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and real 
\begin_inset Formula $0<q<1$
\end_inset 

.
 Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any simple and efficient way
 of extending this result to the general complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane.
\layout Standard

The development proceeds as follows.
 First, an certain specific integral representation is given for the polylogarit
hm.
 This representation is such that a certain trick, here called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

the Borwein trick
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, may be applied, to expressed the integral as a polynomial plus a small
 error term.
 Next, a specific polynomial is selected, and the resulting error term is
 precisely bounded.
 This is followed by a brief presentation of the duplication formula for
 the Hurwitz zeta, and a short discussion of ways in which a numerical algorithm
 may be tested for correctness.
 The algorithm has been implemented by the author using the Gnu Multiple
 Precision arithmetic library
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{GMP}

\end_inset 

, and is available on request, under the terms of the LGPL license.
 The paper concludes with some intriguing images of the Hurwitz zeta function
 on the critical strip.
 
\layout Section

The Polylogarithm
\layout Standard

The polylogarithm has a non-trivial analytic structure.
 For fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, it has a branch cut on the positive real axis, for 
\begin_inset Formula $1<z<+\infty$
\end_inset 

.
 The location of the branch-point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

 is, as is always the case with branch points, the cause of limited convergence
 of analytic series in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 This is noted here, as this branch point has a direct impact on the algorithm.
 The polylogarithm has many interesting properties, which are not reviewed
 here.
\layout Standard

The development of the algorithm requires the following integral representation.
\layout Lemma

The polylogarithm has the integral representation 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)=\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Proof

This identity is easily obtained by inserting the integral representation
 of the Gamma function:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z) & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n^{s}}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-u}u^{s-1}du\\
 & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}z^{n}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-nt}t^{s-1}dt\\
 & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{s-1}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(ze^{-t}\right)^{n}\, dt\\
 & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{s-1}\left[\frac{ze^{-t}}{1-ze^{-t}}\right]\, dt\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 and then finally substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $t=-\log y$
\end_inset 

 in the last integral.
 Although this derivation casually interchanges the order of integration
 and summation, one may appeal to general arguments about analytic continuation
 to argue that the final result is generally valid, provided one is careful
 to navigate about the branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Section

The Borwein trick
\layout Standard

The Borwein trick uses the integral form to find a simple, finite sum that
 approximates the desired value arbitrarily well.
 The trick consists of two steps.
 The first is to write the above integral in the form 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\xi(s,z) & = & \frac{1}{f(1/z)}\,\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{f(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\nonumber \\
 & = & \mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)+\frac{1}{f(1/z)}\,\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{f(y)-f(1/z)}{1-yz}\,\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}dy\label{eq:Borwein trick}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

 The second step is to find a sequence of polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 to be used for 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset 

, such that the integral on the right hand side can be evaluated as a simple,
 finite sum, while the left hand side can be shown to bounded arbitrarily
 close to zero as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset 

.
 The right hand side may be easily evaluated, by employing the following
 theorem.
\layout Theorem

Given a polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(y)$
\end_inset 

 of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, it can be shown that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
r_{n}(y)=\frac{p_{n}(y)-p_{n}(1/z)}{1-yz}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 is again a polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

, of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset 

, provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(1/z)\ne0$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Proof

Write the polynomial as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
p_{n}(y)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}y^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 while for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset 

 assume only a general series: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
r_{n}(y)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}c_{k}y^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset 

, one immediately obtains 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}=a_{0}-p_{n}(1/z)$
\end_inset 

.
 Higher coefficients are obtained by equating derivatives: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
r_{n}^{(k)}(y)=\frac{1}{1-yz}\left[p_{n}^{(k)}(y)+kzr_{n}^{(k-1)}(y)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}^{(k)}(y)$
\end_inset 

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

'th derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset 

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset 

 in the above, one obtains the recurrence relation 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}=a_{k}+zc_{k-1}$
\end_inset 

 which is trivially solvable as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
c_{k}=z^{k}\left[-p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)+\sum_{j=0}^{k}\frac{a_{j}}{z^{j}}\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 From this, it is easily seen that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}=0$
\end_inset 

 and more precisely 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n+m}=0$
\end_inset 

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ge0$
\end_inset 

.
 This concludes the proof that 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}(y)$
\end_inset 

 is a polynomial of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset 

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

This result may be immediately employed in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Borwein trick}

\end_inset 

 to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\xi(s,z)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)+\frac{z}{p_{n}(1/z)}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{c_{k}}{(k+1)^{s}}\label{eq:Polylog general estimate}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 To obtain a good approximation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset 

, one needs to find a polynomial sequence such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

 goes to zero as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset 

 for the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $(s,z)$
\end_inset 

 of interest.
 That is, one seeks to make 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\xi(s,z)=\frac{1}{p_{n}(1/z)}\,\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{p_{n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\label{eq:xi integral}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 as small as possible.
 One possible sequence, based on the Bernoulli process or Gaussian distribution,
 is explored in the next section.
 
\layout Section

The Gaussian Distribution 
\layout Standard

The polynomial sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2n}(y)=y^{n}(1-y)^{n}$
\end_inset 

 seems to have reasonably good properties for this problem.
 It becomes sharply peaked at 
\begin_inset Formula $y=1/2$
\end_inset 

, and subtends a diminishingly small area.
 For large values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, the polynomial sequence approximates a Gaussian:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
p_{2n}(y)=\frac{1}{4^{n}}e^{-4n(y-1/2)^{2}}\left[1+2\left(y-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(\left(y-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{4}\right)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Using this in the integral 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

, and assuming that the real part of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 is not positive, it is not hard to deduce the very crude estimate
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\xi(s,z)\sim\left(\frac{z^{2}}{4(z-1)}\right)^{n}\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which confirms that 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(s,z)$
\end_inset 

 does indeed get suitably small for a certain region in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 However, in order for equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Polylog general estimate}

\end_inset 

 to be useful computationally, an upper bound on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

 needs to be given, as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

.
 This bound is derived in the next section.
 
\layout Standard

The polynomial coefficients are easily obtained, and are 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
a_{0} & = & a_{1}=\cdots=a_{n-1}=0\\
a_{n+k} & = & \left(-1\right)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\quad\mbox{ for }0\le k\le n\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 This leads to 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)=-\frac{z^{2n+1}}{\left(z-1\right)^{n}}\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1}\frac{c_{k}}{\left(k+1\right)^{s}}+\xi(s,z)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset 

 are given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
c_{k}=z^{k}\left[-\left(\frac{z-1}{z^{2}}\right)^{n}+\frac{1}{z^{n}}\sum_{j=0}^{k-n}\left(-1\right)^{j}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
j\end{array}\right)\frac{1}{z^{j}}\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where the summation above is to be understood to be zero when 
\begin_inset Formula $k<n$
\end_inset 

.
 The above summations can be re-organized into the more suggestive form
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{z^{k}}{k^{s}}\;+\frac{1}{\left(1-z\right)^{n}}\;\sum_{k=n+1}^{2n}\frac{z^{k}}{k^{s}}\;\sum_{j=0}^{2n-k}\left(-z\right)^{j}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
j\end{array}\right)+\xi(s,z)\label{eq:polylog specific estimate}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 The error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(s,z)$
\end_inset 

 is negligible for only a very specific area of the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 The region where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

 may be ignored as a small error is derived in the next section.
 Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

 in the above formulas agrees with expressions previously given by Borwein
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Bor95}

\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

The above formula has been implemented using the Gnu Multiple Precision
 arithmetic library (GMP)
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{GMP}

\end_inset 

, and has been numerically validated for correctness in several different
 ways.
 The source code, under the license terms of the LGPL, may be obtained by

\layout Section

Bound on the Error Term
\layout Standard

In order for equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 to be useful computationally, an upper bound on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 needs to be given.
 To compute the polylogarithm to some desired precision, one infers a suitable
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 based on this bound.
 However, to acheive this desired precision, one must not only choose 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 large enough, but one must also maintain a somewhat larger number of digits
 in the intermediate terms, as the appearance of the binomial coefficient
 in the equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 implies that intermediate terms can become quite large, even while mostly
 cancelling.
 This section derives an upper bound on the size of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

, and breifly discusses the issue of the required precision in intermediate
 terms.
 
\layout Standard

The general behaviour of the integrand appearing in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

 depends on the whether 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s\ge1$
\end_inset 

 or not; estimates are presented for these two cases.
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\sigma+i\tau$
\end_inset 

 for real 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

, and assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\ge1$
\end_inset 

 and choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\le n$
\end_inset 

, one has
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\left|p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}\right| & \le & p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{\sigma-1}\label{eq:}\\
 & = & \left|y(1-y)\log y\right|^{\sigma-1}\left(y(1-y)\right)^{n-\sigma+1}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

 Each part of the right hand side is bounded by a Gaussian, and since the
 product of Gaussians is a Gaussian, so is the entire expression.
 From the Stirling approximation, one has the well-known identity 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(y(1-y)\right)^{a}\le\frac{1}{4^{a}}\exp-4a\left(y-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}\]

\end_inset 

 The other part is also bounded by a Gaussian 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|y(1-y)\log y\right|^{a}\le\left|y_{0}\left(1-y_{0}\right)\log y_{0}\right|^{a}\exp\left(-\frac{a\left(y-y_{0}\right)^{2}}{2y_{0}\left(1-2y_{0}\right)}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 whwhich is centered on the maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|y_{0}\left(1-y_{0}\right)\log y_{0}\right|$
\end_inset 

, that is, at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{0}=0.23561058253\ldots$
\end_inset 

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{0}$
\end_inset 

 is the solution to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\frac{d}{dy}\; y(1-y)\left|\log y\right|\]

\end_inset 

 Curiously, the numerical value of the factor in the Gaussian is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2y_{0}(1-2y_{0})=4.013295587\ldots$
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

To evaluate the integral in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

, one also needs a bound on the denominator.
 This is furnished by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\frac{1}{1-yz}\right|\le C(z)=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{ if }\Re z\le0\\
\frac{1}{\left|1-z\right|} & \mbox{ if }0<\Re z\;\mbox{ and }\left|z\right|<1\\
\left|\frac{z}{\Im z}\right| & \mbox{ if }0<\Re z\;\mbox{ and }\left|z\right|>1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset 

 Thus, the integrand is bounded by a Gaussian.
 Multiplying the two Gaussians, completing the square, and evaluating the
 resulting integral is a bit tedious.
 The result is that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\right|\le C(z)\frac{\left|4y_{0}\left(1-y_{0}\right)\log y_{0}\right|^{\sigma-1}}{4^{n}}\, G(s)\]

\end_inset 

 The constant may be taken as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|4y_{0}\left(1-y_{0}\right)\log y_{0}\right|=1.041381965\ldots$
\end_inset 

.
 The factor 
\begin_inset Formula $G(s)$
\end_inset 

 is bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
G(s) & \le & \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{4n}}\exp-\left(1-2y_{0}\right)^{2}\left(\sigma-1\right)\frac{8y_{0}\left(1-2y_{0}\right)}{8y_{0}\left(1-2y_{0}\right)+\frac{\sigma-1}{n-\sigma+1}}\\
 & \le & \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{4n}}\exp-\left(1-2y_{0}\right)^{2}\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}\\
 & \le & 1\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 Useful for estimation is that 
\begin_inset Formula $8y_{0}(1-2y_{0})=0.996687115\ldots$
\end_inset 

.
 Combining these results, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\xi(s,z)\right|\le\frac{1}{4^{n}}\left|\frac{z^{2}}{z-1}\right|^{n}\left|\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\right|C(z)G(s)\left(1.0414\ldots\right)^{\sigma-1}\]

\end_inset 

 for the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le\sigma$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 must be choosen so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\le n$

The case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\le1$
\end_inset 

 may be evaluated as follows.
 One writes 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left|p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}\right| & \le & p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{\sigma-1}\\
 & = & \left|\frac{1-y}{\log y}\right|^{1-\sigma}y^{n}(1-y)^{n+\sigma-1}\\
 & \le & y^{n}(1-y)^{n+\sigma-1}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 The integrand may now be recognized as the Beta function, so that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\right|\le C(z)\frac{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(n+\sigma)}{\Gamma(2n+\sigma+1)}\]

\end_inset 

 In the region where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|\ll n$
\end_inset 

, one may approximate 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(n+\sigma)}{\Gamma(2n+\sigma+1)}\le\frac{2^{1-\sigma}}{4^{n}}\]

\end_inset 

 Combining the various pieces, one obtains a result remarkably similar to
 the previous one;namely, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\le1$
\end_inset 

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|\ll n$
\end_inset 

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\xi(s,z)\right|\le\frac{1}{4^{n}}\left|\frac{z^{2}}{z-1}\right|^{n}\left|\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\right|2^{1-\sigma}C(z)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

For evaluations on the critical line 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=1/2$
\end_inset 

, one needs a good estimate for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Gamma(s)\right|^{-1}$
\end_inset 

, which becomes large.
 A useful estimate for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Gamma(s)\right|^{-1}$
\end_inset 

 is given by Borwein 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Bor00-A,Bor95}

\end_inset 

, for the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\ge-m+1/2$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{\left|\Gamma(s)\right|} & = & \frac{1}{\left|\Gamma(\sigma)\right|}\sqrt{\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(1+\frac{\tau^{2}}{\left(\sigma+k\right)^{2}}\right)}\\
 & \le & \frac{1}{\left|\Gamma(\sigma)\right|}\sqrt{\frac{\sinh\tau\pi}{\tau\pi}\,\prod_{k=0}^{m}\left(1+\frac{\tau^{2}}{\left(\frac{1}{2}+k\right)^{2}}\right)}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 
\layout Standard

A remarkable side-effect of the estimation is that, for 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 equal to negative integers, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(s)$
\end_inset 

 is infinite, thus implying that the error term is zero.
 This somewhat surprising result corresponds to the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{-n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 has an exact expression as a ratio of two polynomials, the denominator
 being of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset 

.
 Indeed, setting 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset 

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset 

 into equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 gives the exact result 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Li}_{0}(z)=\frac{z}{1-z}\]

\end_inset 

 while for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=-1$
\end_inset 

, one must use 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset 

, to obtain the exact result
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Li}_{-1}(z)=\frac{z}{\left(1-z\right)^{2}}\]

\end_inset 

 The generic form for the polylogarithm at the negative integers is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Li}_{-n}(z)=\left(-1\right)^{n}\,\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(-1\right)^{k}\frac{k!}{\left(1-z\right)^{k+1}}\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
n+1\\
k+1\end{array}\right\} \]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right\} $
\end_inset 

 denotes the Stirling numbers of the second kind.
\layout Standard

In general, the formula 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 seems to have the curious property of always evaluating to exactly the
 same rational function whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is a non-positive integer, and 
\begin_inset Formula $-s<n$
\end_inset 

.
 That is, for fixed non-positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, the sum is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 is large enough.
 Thus, this polynomial approximation has the pleasing result of giving exact
 answers in the case when an exact polynomial answer is possible.

Duplication formula
\layout Standard

The formula 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 together with the error bound 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:error bound}

\end_inset 

 allow 
\begin_inset Formula $F(s;q)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)$
\end_inset 

 to be computed for real 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 in region 
\begin_inset Formula $1/4\le q\le3/4$
\end_inset 

.
 To obtain values on the region 
\begin_inset Formula $0<q<1/4$
\end_inset 

, one applies the duplication formula 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F\left(s;q\right)=2^{1-s}F\left(s;2q\right)-F\left(s;q+\frac{1}{2}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 recursively until one obtains values of 
\begin_inset Formula $q\ge1/4$
\end_inset 

.
 Rearranging terms, one obtains a similar formula for iterating values of
 
\begin_inset Formula $q>3/4$
\end_inset 

 until they are less than or equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $3/4$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, as 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 approaches 0 or 1, the algorithm requires more time, but only logarithmically
 so, as 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}q$
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}(1-q)$
\end_inset 

 as the case may be.
\layout Standard

The duplication formula follows from a general 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

-adic identity 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{m=0}^{p-1}F\left(s;\frac{m+q}{p}\right)=p^{1-s}F\left(s;q\right)\]

\end_inset 

 which is valid for any positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

.
 This formula may be obtained by noting that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $F\left(s;q\right)$
\end_inset 

 is an eigenvalue of the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

-adic Bernoulli transfer operator associated with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{1-s}$
\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Ve-B04}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The equivalent formulas for the polylogarithm are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)+\mbox{Li}_{s}(-z)=2^{1-s}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z^{2}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

-adic version has the appearance of a Gauss sum:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{m=0}^{p-1}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(ze^{2\pi im/p}\right)=p^{1-s}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z^{p}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 The repeated application of the duplication formula is crucial for the
 extension of Borwein's algorithm to the entire complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, as, by repeated application, it will map the entire plane into to
 region of convergence of Borwein's algorithm.

Validation
\layout Standard

The correctness of a given numerical implementation can be validated in
 a number of ways.
 For non-positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, one has the exact rational functions previously mentioned.
 For positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, one has the relationship 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{n}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)+\left(-1\right)^{n}\mbox{Li}_{n}\left(e^{-2\pi iq}\right)=-\frac{\left(2\pi i\right)^{n}}{n!}B_{n}(q)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}(x)$
\end_inset 

 are the Bernoulli polynomials.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

, one regains the Riemann zeta function 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s)$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(-1\right)=\frac{1}{2^{1-s}-1}\,\zeta(s)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 For 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<1$
\end_inset 

, the defining series 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog definition}

 is explicitly convergent, and may be directly summed, thus offering another

The

\end_inset 

Periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Zeta Function
\layout Standard

The ability to compute the polylogarithm allows one to visualize some of
 the interesting sums that occur in number theory.
 One such example is the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

periodic zeta function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, defined by Apostol
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[Thm 12.6]{Apo76}

\end_inset 

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F(q,s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{i2\pi nq}}{n^{s}}\label{eq:periodic zeta}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Clearly, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $F(q,s)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 The periodic zeta function occurs when one attempts to state a reflection
 formula for the Hurwitz zeta function, as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(1-s,q)=\frac{\Gamma(s)}{(2\pi)^{s}}\left[e^{-i\pi s/2}F(q,s)+e^{i\pi s/2}F(-q,s)\right]\label{eq:Hurwitz reflection}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 What makes the periodic zeta function interesting is that 
\emph on 
it is not actually periodic
\emph default 
.
 That one might think it is seems obvious from the definition 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:periodic zeta}

\end_inset 

: the direct substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to q+1$
\end_inset 

 gives the false suggestion of periodicity in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

.
 This is false because, in fact, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset 

 has a branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 zeta function is multi-sheeted, and, attempting to trace a continuous path
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to q+1$
\end_inset 

, while keeping 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 real carries one through the branch-point, and from one sheet to the next.
 This may be illustrated in several ways; first, graphically, in figures
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Periodic-zeta-function}

This graph shows the real and imaginary parts of the periodic zeta function
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F(q,s)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\frac{1}{2}+i25$
\end_inset 

.
 This value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is close to a zero of the Riemann zeta function, at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\frac{1}{2}+i25.01085758014\ldots$
\end_inset 

 Thus, both the real and imaginary parts approach zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset 

, as well as at 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 The increasing oscillations as 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

 are due to the contribution of the very first term of the Hurwitz zeta:
 that is, these oscillations are nothing other than that of 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{-s}=e^{i25\log q}/\sqrt{q}$
\end_inset 

.
 Subtracting these away is the same as analytically continuing to the region
 
\begin_inset Formula $q>1$
\end_inset 

, and matches the coarser set of oscillations, which are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $(1+q)^{-s}=e^{i25\log(1+q)}/\sqrt{1+q}$
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This image can be understood as horizontal cross section of the previous
 image, running through the middle of the image.
 
\layout Standard

Noteworthy is that the presumed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

periodicity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 is very misleading: the image suggests an essential singularity at 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0$
\end_inset 

, and continuing, logarithmically slower oscillatory behaviour for the analytic
 continuation to the region where 
\begin_inset Formula $q>1$
\end_inset 

.
\end_inset 

 
\layout Standard

The first figure, 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Periodic-zeta-function}

\end_inset 

, shows an oscillatory behaviour that clearly diverges as 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

.
 This oscillation is can be simply explained.
 Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\frac{1}{2}+i\tau$
\end_inset 

 into equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz reflection}

\end_inset 

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}-i\tau,\, q\right)=\frac{e^{-i\pi/4}e^{-i\tau\log2\pi}e^{i\phi}}{\sqrt{2\cosh\tau\pi}}\left[e^{\pi\tau/2}F(q,s)+ie^{-\pi\tau/2}F(-q,s)\right]\]

\end_inset 

 after the substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+i\tau\right)=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}e^{i\phi}}{\sqrt{\cosh\tau\pi}}\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset 

 is a purely real phase that can be expressed as a somewhat complicated
 sum
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[eqn 6.1.27]{A&S}

\end_inset 

.
 For reasonably large, positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=25$
\end_inset 

 in the picture, one may ignore the second term, so that the whole expression
 simplifies to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F\left(\frac{1}{2}+i\tau,\, q\right)\approx\exp\, i\left(\frac{\pi}{4}+\phi+\tau\log2\pi\right)\;\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}-i\tau,\, q\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Then, as 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

, the leading contribution to the Hurwitz zeta comes from the 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0$
\end_inset 

 term in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz zeta}

\end_inset 

: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{-s}=e^{-i\tau\log q}/\sqrt{q}$
\end_inset 

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F\left(\frac{1}{2}+i\tau,\, q\right)\approx\frac{e^{i\tau\log q}e^{i\psi}}{\sqrt{q}}\;\mbox{ as }q\to0\label{eq:F-approx}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 for some fixed, real phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset 

 that is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

.
 As is eminently clear from both the picture 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Periodic-zeta-function}

\end_inset 

, and from the approximation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:F-approx}

\end_inset 

, the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $F(q,s)$
\end_inset 

 cannot be taken: this is the branch-point of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset 

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

Curiously, the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to1$
\end_inset 

 does exist, and one has 
\begin_inset Formula $F(1,s)=\zeta(s)$
\end_inset 

 the Riemann zeta.
 The approximation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:F-approx}

\end_inset 

 shows how to move through the branch point, from one sheet to the next:
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:F-approx}

\end_inset 

 is the discontinuity between sheets.
 That is, one has
\begin_inset Formula \[
F\left(\frac{1}{2}+i\tau,\, q+1\right)=F\left(\frac{1}{2}+i\tau,\, q\right)-\frac{e^{i\tau\log q}e^{i\psi}}{\sqrt{q}}\]

\end_inset 

 as the formula that expresses the movement from one sheet to the next.
 In essence, this shows that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 zeta function is not at all periodic: 
\begin_inset Formula $F(s,q+1)\ne F(s,q)$
\end_inset 

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s\le1$
\end_inset 

.
 This discontinuity also manifests itself in other ways; this is in fact
 the very same discontinuity seen in the Jacobi theta function 
\begin_inset Formula $\vartheta(q,\tau)$
\end_inset 

 in the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\to-i0$
\end_inset 

, where it is seen to become the Dirac comb, the periodic sum of Dirac delta
 functions.
 That this is the same discontinuity may be seen by noting that the Hurwitz
 zeta function may be defined as an integral over the theta function XXX

Conclusion
\layout Standard

The updated algorithm apears to offer a stable and fast way of computing
 the Hurwitz zeta function for general complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and real 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

.
 It allows the polylogarithm to be compted over an extended range as well.
 An actual implementation using a variable-precision library shows that
 the algorithm is quite tractable.
 An unexplored area is the optimal implementation of the algorithm using
 standard IEEE double-precision floating-point mathematics.
 Preliminary work shows that some of the intermediate terms are just large
 enough so that rounding error may be of concern; the region of high-precision
 convergence has not been characterized.
 The propagation of rounding erors through the algorithm has not been characteri
zed.
 Such a characterization is necessary before reliable double-precision code
 can be created.
 By contrast, such considerations can be swept under the carpet when employing
 arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
\layout Standard

Additional effort should be placed into the proper and speedy evaluation
 of the bound
