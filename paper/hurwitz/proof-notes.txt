Q1: The address as shown, will do.

lines 6-9 - please strike lines 6-9, and replace by

   "by Borwein for computing the Riemann zeta function, to more
    general series."

line 96 - Slezeviciene should have carons, not circonflex, above 
     the S and z (the caron over the c is correct).

line 247 - "One problem with the (11) ..." should read
           "One problem with equation (11) ..."
           or 
           "One problem with (11) ..."

line 276 - "... is really ..." should be "... really is ..."

line 348  - replace "...gets increasingly good ..." by "... improves ..."

The equation between lines 356 and 357 needs a minor correction; 
       the epsilon at the end of the formula needs a subscript "n",
       so that e(s,z) becomes e_n(s,z)   (the underbar denoting
       subscript)
line 374 - "...coefficient in the (23)" should be "...coefficient in (23)"
line 378 - "in ..." should be "for ..."

Q2: The figure citation is akward. I propose the following, 
which should still leave the figures well-distributed in the text,
but in a more appropriate order. I suspect that this might alter
the figure numbering; I won't guess the new numbers, rather, I will
refer to the figures by the numbers as currently shown.
-- line 550, remove citation to fig 5 6 7 8 9.
-- line 587, add citations to fig 12, 13, 14, 15
-- line 638, remove citation to fig 12. 
-- line 640, 641, change "...image (11)..." to ...Fig. 11 ..."
-- line 760, insert at start of line: "The monodromy corresponding to 
             this presentation is shown in figure 5."
-- line 781, remove citation to fig 15.
-- line 801, insert ref to Fig. 7 before "... defined by Apostol..."
-- line 199, 200: replace final sentence with "This paper includes
             intriguing images of the polylogarithm and the 
             Hurwitz zeta function (Fig. 7, 8 and 9)."
-- lines 874-880: strike these lines entirely, as they are no
             longer applicable to the new figure layout.
             (This answers Q4: the dummy citation is not needed 
             any more).

I beleive the above modifications should result in a reasonably
uniform distribution of the figures throughout the text.

Q3: Yes, Fig 15 looks good.


line 588 - "...when qis not an integer..." insert space 
           between "q" and "is".

line 613 - strike "note that"
line 683 - "None-the-less" should be one word, noo dashes: so
           "Nonetheless"
line 747 - "... ones ..." should be possesive "... one's ..."
line 882 - capitalize M in Mathematical, F in Functions (this is 
           a book title)
line 885 - captialize H in Hurwitz
line 903 - capitalize C Computing M Methods (this is a book title)
line 909 - replace <c3><a9> by accent e-acute (just as in line 128)
line 918 - captialize H in Hurwitz
line 927 - Slezeviciene should have carons above the S, z and c.


Figure 7: In the figure caption, about 3/4 of the say down, strike
        the words "...(need ref)."  The final sentence should be
        modified to read "... as illustrated in Fig. 8."

All figures: The final sentence in each caption appears to be missing
        a period.
