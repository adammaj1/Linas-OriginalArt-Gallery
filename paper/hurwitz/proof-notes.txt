Q1: The address as shown, will do.

lines 6-9 - please strike lines 6-9, and replace by

   "by Borwein for computing the Riemann zeta function, to more
    general series."

line 96 - Slezeviciene should have carons, not circonflex, above 
     the S and z (the caron over the c is correct).

line 247 - "One problem with the (11) ..." should read
           "One problem with equation (11) ..."

line 276 - "... is really ..." should be "... really is ..."

line 348  - replace "...gets increasingly good ..." by "... improves ..."

The equation between lines 356 and 357 needs a minor correction; 
       the epsilon at the end of the formula needs a subscript "n",
       so that e(s,z) becomes e_n(s,z)   (the underbar denoting
       subscript)
line 374 - "...coefficient in the (23)" should be "...coefficient in (23)"
line 378 - "in ..." should be "for ..."

Q2: The figure citation is akward. I propose the following, 
which should still leave the figures well-distributed in the text,
but in a more appropriate order. I suspect that this might alter
the figure numbering; I won't guess the new numbers, rather, I will
refer to the figures by the numbers as currently shown.
-- line 550, remove citation to fig 5 6 7 8 9.
-- line 587, add citations to fig 12, 13, 14, 15

-- If this results in the images being excsively bunched up at 
   the end f the article, I suggest citing xx at yy.

line 588: "...when qis not an integer..." insert space 
    between "q" and "is".

line 613: strike "note that"

line 885 - captialize H in Hurwitz
line 909 - replace <c3><a9> by accent e-acute (just as in line 128)
line 918 - captialize H in Hurwitz
line 927 - Slezeviciene should have carons above the S, z and c.


====================
Appendix name ???

lin 683 - nonetheless   no dashes
line 747 -- one's


zeros zeroes ?
