\begin_layout Title
Quaternions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\end_layout

\begin_layout Date

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
An exploration of quaternions, in the context of all of the usual places
 where I've been playing with analytic combinatorics.
 Why? Because quaternions are symplectic, because classical mechanics is
 symplectic, because spin manifolds require quaternions, because the Riemann
 Hypothesis has something symplectic about it â€“ the non-trivial Riemann
 zeros seem to be the zeros of ...
 wait for it ...
 some symplectic operator.
 With that in mind, lets make a map of some of the nearby landscape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unfortunately, little is actually accomplished here.
 Mostly observe that candidate shift operators have wildly different spectra.
 (This is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

best
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 synopsis of spectra so far...
 previous attempts were garbled.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far, this writing says nothing at all beyond the abstract.
 Nothing at all ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The below will employ the standard notation for quaternions, namely, anti-commut
ing 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j,k$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{2}=j^{2}=k^{2}=-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ij=k=-ji$
\end_inset

, etc.
 In the past, I've always championed the Pauli matrices as being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as they square to 1.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

problem
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with Pauli matrices is that geodesics require you to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(-i\tau\cdot\theta\right)$
\end_inset

 with that extra 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in there, whereas the usual definition of geodesics is done without appeal
 to complex numbers.
 That extra 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 seems to be an endless source of confusion, and so what follows will attempt
 to avoid it, by working with the quaternions directly.
 Of course, these representations are isomorphic, so one can always switch
 notation as is convenient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, the complex-number 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is easily confused with the quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and so therefore, in what follows, the quaternions shall be 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{3}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}=1$
\end_inset

.
 This leaves 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{4}$
\end_inset

 open for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

emergency use
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The representation to be used will be:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
i_{1} & \mapsto-i\tau_{1}=-i\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -i\\
-i & 0
\end{array}\right]\\
i_{2} & \mapsto-i\tau_{2}=-i\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -i\\
i & 0
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right]\\
i_{3} & \mapsto-i\tau_{3}=-i\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & -1
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
-i & 0\\
0 & i
\end{array}\right]\\
i_{0} & \mapsto I=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $\mapsto$
\end_inset

 symbol is actually an isomorphism.
 In the following, there will be sloppiness, andthe equals sign will sometimes
 be used.
 I think this is safe, even though, clearly, the Pauli algebra is 
\emph on
NOT
\emph default
 isomorphic to the quaternion algebra! We'll try to keep this in mind, just
 in case it tries to stab us in the back, somewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note also there is another isomorphism, that of 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}\mapsto I$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1}=i\tau_{3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{2}=i\tau_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{3}=i\tau_{1}$
\end_inset

 which is popular, and may hold some notational advantages.
 So far, I don't know of a reason to prefer one over the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $h=a+bi_{1}+ci_{2}+di_{3}$
\end_inset

, let the conjugate be 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{h}=a-bi_{1}-ci_{2}-di_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Define the norm as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert h\right\Vert ^{2}=\overline{h}h=h\overline{h}=a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The corresponding complex matrix is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h=a+bi_{1}+ci_{2}+di_{3}\mapsto A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
a-id & -(c+ib)\\
c-ib & a+id
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
z & -w\\
\overline{w} & \overline{z}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $z=a-id$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w=c+ib$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det A=\overline{h}h$
\end_inset

.
 The conjugate is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{h}=a-bi_{1}-ci_{2}-di_{3}\mapsto A^{\dagger}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
a+id & (c+ib)\\
-\left(c-ib\right) & a-id
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\overline{z} & w\\
-\overline{w} & z
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 is the matrix complex-conjugate-transpose.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\dagger}A=\overline{h}hI$
\end_inset

 is diagonal.
 That is, the unit-length quaternions, called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

versors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, form the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)$
\end_inset

 as usual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternate representation uses vector notation, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $h\mapsto\left(r,\vec{v}\right)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $r\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 The product is then simply 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(r,\vec{u}\right)\left(s,\vec{v}\right)=\left(r+s-\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v},r\vec{v}+s\vec{u}+\vec{u}\times\vec{v}\right)
\]

\end_inset

This notation enables a simple polar-coordinate form.
 Write 
\begin_inset Formula $h\mapsto\left(r,\vec{\theta}\right)$
\end_inset

; then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\exp h\mapsto e^{r}\left(\cos\left\Vert \vec{\theta}\right\Vert +\hat{\theta}\sin\left\Vert \vec{\theta}\right\Vert \right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}=\vec{\theta}/\left\Vert \vec{\theta}\right\Vert $
\end_inset

.
 The logarithm is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln h\mapsto\ln\left\Vert h\right\Vert +\hat{\theta}\arccos\frac{r}{\left\Vert h\right\Vert }
\]

\end_inset

The polar coordinate form is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h\mapsto\left\Vert h\right\Vert \exp\hat{\theta}\phi=\left\Vert h\right\Vert \left(\cos\phi+\hat{\theta}\sin\phi\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\phi=r/\left\Vert h\right\Vert $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin\phi=\left\Vert \vec{\theta}\right\Vert /\left\Vert h\right\Vert $
\end_inset

.
 Raising to a real power 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 then becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h^{a}=\left\Vert h\right\Vert ^{a}\left(\cos a\phi+\hat{\theta}\sin a\phi\right)
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Section
Bernoulli process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This should be easy, as we've pounded this topic to death.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $b\in2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 be an infinite string of binary digits, where 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 is the Cantor set, as usual.
 The object of interest is the analytic series 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b\mapsto b\left(h\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}b_{k}h^{k}
\]

\end_inset

and the corresponding action of the shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $T:\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\cdots\right)=\left(b_{1},b_{2},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Naively, all of the old results still hold, with the naive substitution
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $z\mapsto h$
\end_inset

, so nothing new seems to be gained.
 Some of the old results were written in terms of polar coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $z=re^{i\theta}$
\end_inset

 and one could do likewise here, as well.
 Of course, for the analytic series, one could write anything (any matrix)
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 in the series expansion.
 The question is, of course 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is there anything new when one does so?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 OK, for the moment, lets imagine a symplectic manifold and 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in Sp\left(n\right)=U\left(n,\mathbb{H}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a canonical transformation on the tangent space of the symplectic manifold.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{n}$
\end_inset

 is a repeated canonical transformation, since 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{n}\in Sp\left(n\right)$
\end_inset

.
 By hand-waving, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b\left(A\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}b_{k}A^{k}\in Sp\left(n\right)
\]

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $Sp\left(n\right)$
\end_inset

 is compact and contains it's limits.
 The result would seem to be a five-real-parameter family, four for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and one for 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 that paints some wild fractal curves on the space of canonical transformations.
 Big deal, so what?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What about eigenfunctions of the shift operator? These would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset

-valued functions on the cylinder-set (coarse) topology on 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 I was never good at constructing these, so lets start with the simpler
 case: the Fourier representation for functions on the unit real interval
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]\subset\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

; where elements 
\begin_inset Formula $b\in2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 can be mapped to reals as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b\mapsto x=x\left(b\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}b_{k}2^{-k-1}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fourier fractal representation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the fourier representation, write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f\left(x\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}\cos2\pi nx+b_{n}\sin2\pi nx\label{eq:Fourier series}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n},b_{n}\in\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset

.
 The transfer operator for the Bernoulli process is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}f\right]\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+f\left(\frac{x+1}{2}\right)\right)\label{eq:bernoulli shift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Applied to the Fourier series, this gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}f\right]\left(x\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{2n}\cos2\pi nx+b_{2n}\sin2\pi nx
\]

\end_inset

By orthogonality, the solutions to the eigenvalue equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}f=\lambda f$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset

 will have 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\ne1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{2n}=\lambda a_{n}$
\end_inset

 and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Solving this indicates that the odd-indexed coefficients can be choosen
 freely, while the even-indexed ones are powers of the odd ones.
 That is, one has that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{2^{k}\left(2j+1\right)}=\lambda^{k}a_{2j+1}
\]

\end_inset

This in turn implies a linearly-independent basis for the space of eigenfunction
s; these would be linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{j}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{k}\cos2\pi\left(2j+1\right)x
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{j}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{k}\sin2\pi\left(2j+1\right)x
\]

\end_inset

This is exactly the same as before (equation 8.7, page 39 of

periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is in quotes; although it appears to superficially be periodic in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, it is not; the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a branch-point of the polylogarithm.
 This is explored in greater detail in ref.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

periodic zeta function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes from Tom Apostol's book on analytic number theory.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 zeta eigenfunctions (eqn 7.5 page 26 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) which were given as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta\left(x;s\right)=2\Gamma\left(s+1\right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(2\pi n\right)^{-s}\exp2\pi inx
\]

\end_inset

which produced the associated eigen-equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}\beta=2^{-s}\beta$
\end_inset

 with the understanding that 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 a complex number.
 However, these manipulations are entirely formal; the same result holds
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset

 provided that we can adquately define 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{s}$
\end_inset

 for quaternionic 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 To avoid further confusion, it is worth using the purely real form, and
 dropping the leading gamma factor and write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C\left(x;s\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-s}\cos2\pi nx\quad\mbox{ and }\quad S\left(x;s\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-s}\sin2\pi nx
\]

\end_inset

which both satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}C=2^{-s}C$
\end_inset

 and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $S.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To generalize to quaternionuc 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset

, write 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-s}=\exp\left(-s\ln n\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This is then readily expanded in polar coordinates for the quaternions.
 Using the vector representation, write 
\begin_inset Formula $s\mapsto\left(r,\vec{\theta}\right)$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

, one then has the vector 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n^{-s}\mapsto\exp\left(-s\ln n\right)=n^{-r}\left(\cos\nu+\hat{\theta}\sin\nu\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=\left\Vert \vec{\theta}\right\Vert \ln n$
\end_inset

 (assuming I didn't make a mistake).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fixing the quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, the eigenvalue is now, of course, just 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda=2^{-s}=2^{-r}\left(\cos\left\Vert \vec{\theta}\right\Vert \ln2+\hat{\theta}\sin\left\Vert \vec{\theta}\right\Vert \ln2\right)
\]

\end_inset

By periodicity, the eigenvalue is unchanged by replacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \vec{\theta}\right\Vert \ln2\to\left\Vert \vec{\theta}\right\Vert \ln2+2\pi m$
\end_inset

, and so we have a one-integer-paramter family of quaternions leading to
 the same eigenvalue.
 That is, given 
\begin_inset Formula $s\mapsto\left(r,\vec{\theta}\right)$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{m}\mapsto\left(r,\vec{\theta}+\frac{2\pi m}{\ln2}\hat{\theta}\right)
\]

\end_inset

is another quaternion yielding the same eigenvalue, and so one has a parameteriz
ed family of solutions 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{m}\left(x;s\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-s_{m}}\cos2\pi nx
\]

\end_inset

and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{m}\left(x;s\right)$
\end_inset

 all having the same eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=2^{-s}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spectrum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exactly what the spectrum is, is not entirely clear.
 Clearly the sum converges for 
\begin_inset Formula $r>1$
\end_inset

 and certainly, the sum, as naively written, should diverge for 
\begin_inset Formula $r<1$
\end_inset

.
 Presumably there is a simple pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset

.
 Perhaps it might be possible to analytically continue into the region 
\begin_inset Formula $r<1$
\end_inset

 but the details of this may be daunting.
 There are no obvious branch points or other singularities, so analytic
 continuation should be possible, one might think.
 However, the polylogarithm is hiding in here, and the polylog does have
 branch-points at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

.
 But that just means that the eigenfunctions might not be square-integrable
 at these end-points.
 The square-integrable eigenspectrum is worth understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that the egeinfunctions can be extended to the 
\begin_inset Formula $r=1/2$
\end_inset

 line.
 The Riemann zeta zeros then ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(x;s\right)$
\end_inset

 vanishes at the interval endpoints (by naive substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(x;s\right)$
\end_inset

.) Must be careful being naive - these endpoints also correspond to the branchpoi
nts of the polylogarithm.
 This needs to be further clarified, via reference

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing naively -- points on the complex plane are no longer single points,
 but are presumably spheres, as certainly one can take 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $j$

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to correspond to the imaginary axis, or any vector arrived at by rotation
 via 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3)$

 Homotopy has been bumped up by two dimensions, which seems to have strange

Symplectic group

\begin_layout Standard
Let's take a quick look at the compact symplectic group 
\begin_inset Formula $Sp\left(n\right)\cong U\left(n,\mathbb{H}\right)$
\end_inset

, of which the quaternions are a special case: 
\begin_inset Formula $Sp\left(1\right)\cong U\left(1,\mathbb{H}\right)\cong SU\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

 Some notes:

 In classical mechanics, it preserves the Poisson bracket and the form of

Simple harmonic oscillator

\begin_layout Standard
Without further ado, set 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

.
 Consider first the classical simple harmonic oscillator 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=\frac{1}{2}\left(p^{2}+x^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\left(\begin{array}{c}
x\\
p
\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset

as a ordinary real-valued 2-vector; then clearly 
\begin_inset Formula $H=Z^{T}Z/2$
\end_inset

 is preserved under coordinate changes with the symetry of 
\begin_inset Formula $SO\left(2\right)\cong U\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Writing the same complex 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\in\mathbb{C}^{2}$
\end_inset

 one then has 
\begin_inset Formula $H=Z^{\dagger}Z/2$
\end_inset

 is preserved by rotations in 
\begin_inset Formula $SU\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

.
 (In the more general setting, this is a special case of a Hermitian manifold,
 having a Hermitian structure).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classical simple harmonic oscillator can be quantized by replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $p\to d/dx$
\end_inset

 per usual; one obtains the ladder operators 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{*}$
\end_inset

 per usual, as the rotated-by 45 degrees linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 These act as shift operators on the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 being the vacuum, so its a one-sided shift because 
\begin_inset Formula $a\left|0\right\rangle =0$
\end_inset

.
 To be more precise, the ladder operators aren't actually shifts; they have
 an extra factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n+1}$
\end_inset

 so as to write the Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H=a^{*}a+1/2$
\end_inset

 having eignevalues 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1/2$
\end_inset

.
 The spectrum is positive-definite, there is no way to extend this to a
 two-sided shift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More precisely, the spectrum is discrete only when considering the space
 of square-integrable functions on the real line.
 If one abandons square-integrability, the spectrum is continuous.
 To be precise, then, the spectrum of an operator depends on the space on
 which it acts; its a property of the space, and not of the operator.

Define
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J=\left(\begin{array}{cc}

\end_inset

One then has that 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{T}JZ=xp-px$
\end_inset

 is non-zero only if 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 do not commute.
 It is convenient here to reverse the sign, so write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=-Z^{T}JZ=px-xp
\]

\end_inset

This is invariant under the symplectic group, we can re-write 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\to MZ$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $M\in Sp\left(2,\mathbb{C}\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $M^{T}JM=J$

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Skew form on complex plane
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $x\mapsto z\in\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\mapsto d/dz$
\end_inset

, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $pz=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $[p,z]f\left(z\right)=\left(pz-zp\right)f\left(z\right)=f\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 for any analytic series 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)=c_{0}+c_{1}z+c_{2}z^{2}+\cdots$
\end_inset

 , and so for this special case, 
\begin_inset Formula $H=1$
\end_inset

.
 The point here, is that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is a shift operator, acting on the analytic series 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

.
 It is a one-sided shift, as 
\begin_inset Formula $pc_{0}=0$
\end_inset

.
 To be precise, it's not quite a shift, having an extra factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in it, as, 
\begin_inset Formula $pz^{n}=nz^{n-1}$
\end_inset

.
 It can be extended to a two-sided shift, since 
\begin_inset Formula $pz^{n}=nz^{n-1}$
\end_inset

 works just fine for 
\begin_inset Formula $n<0$
\end_inset

 but it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

broken
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the middle, at zero.
 One can, or course, define two-sided shifts; however, the shifts are multiplica
tion and division by 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 and division by 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is not isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

For the special case of the harmonic oscillator, the identification is

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\mapsto a$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $H\mapsto aa^{*}-a^{*}a$
\end_inset

 But this is the standard commutation relation, so 
\begin_inset Formula $H=1$
\end_inset

 for the harmonic oscillator as well.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Skew form on the Cantor set
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the one-sided shift on the Cantor set 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

, write 
\begin_inset Formula $x\mapsto\mathcal{K}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\mapsto\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 is the Bernoulli shift: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\cdots\right)=\left(b_{1},b_{2},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}$
\end_inset

 is the Koopman operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}\left(b_{0},b_{1},\cdots\right)=\left(0,b_{0},b_{1},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

 which shifts in a zero into the first position (this is analogous to mutiplicat
ion-by-
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 which 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shifts in
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 a zero to the first term of an analytic series, instead of shifting in
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

some constant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or to the raising operator 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{*}$
\end_inset

 which destroys the vacuum state.) The comutator has the action
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\cdots\right)=\left[\mathcal{LK-KL}\right]\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\cdots\right)=\left(b_{0},0,0,0,\cdots\right)
\]

\end_inset

That is, it preserves the first bit of the bit-string, but wipes out the
 remainder.
 So this is very unlike the prior cases; certainly, 
\begin_inset Formula $H\ne1$
\end_inset

 here.
 The spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 here is very simple, though: it has exactly one eigenvector, and one eigenvalue.
 (Well, two, the zero-eigenvalue has a huge eigenspace).

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Skew form on the Bernoulli shift
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unclear here is how 
\begin_inset Formula $SU\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

 should act on the Bernoulli shift.
 For the harmonic oscillator, one can hand-wave, since there are already
 complex numbers bubbling in the brew; for the Bernoulli shift, there is
 not.
 One could 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

make something up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but what does that acheive?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the one-sided Bernoulli shift, that is, for eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bernoulli shift"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the result is mildly surprising.
 The Koopman operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}$
\end_inset

 makes two copies of a function, squeezing them into the unit interval,
 with a prominant discontinuity at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

.
 One has 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{LK}=1$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{\mathcal{KL}}}$
\end_inset

 makes two copies of the average of the two sides.
 From 
\begin_inset Formula $Hf=\lambda f$
\end_inset

, we conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{KL}f=\left(1-\lambda\right)f$
\end_inset

.
 The kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is easy to describe: given some arbitrary, unconstrainted function 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 on the unit interval, use it to construct twio copies:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(x\right)=\left[\mathcal{K}g\right]\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
g\left(2x\right) & \mbox{ for }0\le x<1/2\\
g\left(2x-1\right) & \mbox{ for }1/2\le x\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

and its clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is in the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}f=g$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{KL}f=\mathcal{K}g=f$
\end_inset

.
 What's not in the kernel? Lots.
 Everything not in the kernel can be arrived at by projecting out the kernel,
 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 just subtract out the kernel.
 This gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[Hf\right]\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
f\left(x\right)-\left[\mathcal{L}f\right]\left(2x\right) & \mbox{ for }0\le x<1/2\\
f\left(x\right)-\left[\mathcal{L}f\right]\left(2x+1\right) & \mbox{ for }1/2\le x\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

Can we find a spectrum, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 can we find solutions to 
\begin_inset Formula $Hf=\lambda f$
\end_inset

? From the upper branch, conclude that we are looking for solutions to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}f\right]\left(x\right)=\left(1-\lambda\right)f\left(x/2\right)$
\end_inset

, while the lower branch implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}f\right]\left(x\right)=\left(1-\lambda\right)f\left(\left(x+1\right)/2\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Combining these then forces 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x/2\right)=f\left(\left(x+1\right)/2\right)$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 two copies of the same thing, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $f=\mathcal{K}g$
\end_inset

 for some otherwise arbitary, unconstrained 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 But then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}f=\mathcal{LK}g=g$
\end_inset

 and so we're back where we started: 
\begin_inset Formula $Hf=0$
\end_inset

.
 This conclusion can only be evaded if 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

; in this case, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $Hf=f$
\end_inset

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}f=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is a two-point spectrum, of 0 and 1.
 We can double-check our work by limiting ourselves to square-integrable
 functions, as below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing as above, consider the skew form on Fourier series.
 As before, take

 to be the Fourrrier series from eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Fourier series"

\end_inset

.
 Again, 
\begin_inset Formula $H=\mathcal{LK-KL}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{LK}=1$
\end_inset

; what is 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{\mathcal{KL}}}$
\end_inset

? It makes two copies of the average of both sides...
 Repeating ourselves a bit; given 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g\left(x\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}\cos2\pi nx+b_{n}\sin2\pi nx
\]

\end_inset

Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}g$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{K}g\right]\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
g\left(2x\right) & \mbox{ for }0\le x<1/2\\
g\left(2x-1\right) & \mbox{ for }1/2\le x\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

but that is just periodic:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{K}g\right]\left(x\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}\cos4\pi nx+b_{n}\sin4\pi nx
\]

\end_inset

Thus, going back to eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Fourier series"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{KL}f\right]\left(x\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{2n}\cos4\pi nx+b_{2n}\sin4\pi nx
\]

\end_inset

and so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[Hf\right]\left(x\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\alpha_{n}\cos2\pi nx+\beta_{n}\sin2\pi nx
\]

\end_inset

with
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha_{n}=\begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{ for }n\mbox{ even}\\
a_{n} & \mbox{ for }n\mbox{ odd}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 We conclude what we already know: 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 kills all functions that have even harmonics, it's the identity on those
 with odd harmonics.
 It's a projection, its a filter.
 Unlike before, here we can say that 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the identity on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

half
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the space, and zero on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

half
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the space, and argue that it is literally 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

half
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's some temptation to write a short exact sequence
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0\to K\to F\to F/K\to0
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 being all Fourrier series, and 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 being Fourrier series with only even coefficients.
 But I can't think of anything interesting to do with this.
 It seems to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trivial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because obviously 
\begin_inset Formula $F=K\times O$
\end_inset

 with

\end_inset

 the Fourrier series with odd coefficients.
 The factorization is trivial.
