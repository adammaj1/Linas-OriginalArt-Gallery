\begin_layout Abstract
Lie algebras can be mapped to Lie groups by means of the exp map.
 But what happens if the exp map is replaced by some arbitrary series? That
 is the question being asked here.
 That is, given an element 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\mathfrak{a}$
\end_inset

 the exp map defines a group element 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in\mathfrak{A}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $g=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{n}/n!$
\end_inset

 The question posed here is that, given a series of (real) numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and a (real) algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{a}$
\end_inset

 (not necessarily a Lie agebra), what does one get when one computes 
\begin_inset Formula $s(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}x^{n}/n!$
\end_inset

 ? Perhaps there are questions of convergence; what are they, and how can
 they be phrased? Clearly, the 
\begin_inset Formula $s(x)$
\end_inset

 are a ring over the reals; might they be a group? How and when? Under what
 situations are the 
\begin_inset Formula $s(x)$
\end_inset

 elements of a Lie group? What might the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula
 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $s(x)$
\end_inset

 look like? Perhaps it is easier to work in the (universal) enveloping algebra
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{a}$
\end_inset

, in which case, what does the star product (Moyal product) look like? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
When is 
\begin_inset Formula $s(x)$
\end_inset

 equal to zero? Are there algebraic varieties -- i.e.
 can the tools of algebraic varieties be applied?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Which algebras are the most interesting to consider first? Would the Clifford
 algebras be a good place to start? Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Cl}\left(\mathbb{R}\right)=\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 so perhaps 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Cl}\left(\mathbb{R}^{2}\right)=\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset

 is a good next step...? Or maybe quaternions? Why?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever that may be.
 Where to start? Surely these kinds of questions have been asked before?
 What are the answers so far? This seems vaguely similar to the Kashvilli-
 blah blah operator equations ...
 Am I actually talking about Banach algebras??? Yes, I guess they're topological
 vector spaces of some kind ...
 but I am interested in the analytic properties...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Answer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's why this is not ever studied or talked about, as far as I can tell:
 its actually boring.
 So for a Lie algebra, the exp map is actually movement along a geodesic,
 and is of constant speed.
 What we are doing above is changing the rate of motion along the geodesic,
 without actually changing it's direction.
 In other words, in the above notation, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}\frac{x^{n}}{n!}=\exp\left(f(\left|x\right|)\widehat{x}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{x}$
\end_inset

 is the unit direction in the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|x\right|$
\end_inset

 is the length of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is some function.
 That is, the effect of the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset

 is isotropic.
 The proof of the above requires a review of the construction of exp as
 the integral path of a geodesic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, the above is not quite right.
 Its gets the general idea, but the details are wrong.
 The problem is that we don't know how to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{n}$
\end_inset

 unless 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is acutally 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset

 for some matrix representation 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the real question is: can anything interesting be gained by tangling
 up the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 with the structure coefficients of some Lie algebra? That is, for every
 such sequence, there is some corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 that is the result of tangling.
 What is that, and is it ever useful in any way? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets try to work this out a bit more.
 In general, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\sum_{k}x_{k}e_{k}
\]

\end_inset

where we assume the algebra has basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 So: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x^{2}=?
\]

\end_inset

Oh wait, this is not even well-defined, until we pick a representation for
 the (Lie) algebra...
 so 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 depends on the representation.
 So the initial question was not well-defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, lets pick a familiar one: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{su}(2)$
\end_inset

 in the fundamental rep, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}=-i\sigma_{k}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}$
\end_inset

 are the Pauli matrices, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}=\delta_{ij}+i\epsilon_{ijk}\sigma_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}e_{j}=-\delta_{ij}+\epsilon_{ijk}e_{k}$
\end_inset

 is pure-real.
 One then gets that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
x^{2}= & \left(\sum_{i}x_{i}e_{i}\right)\left(\sum_{j}x_{j}e_{j}\right)\\
= & -\sum_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}\delta_{ij}\\
= & -\left|x\right|^{2}\mathbb{I}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}$
\end_inset

 is the unit matrix.
 Continuing to expand,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
s(x)= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}\frac{x^{n}}{n!}\\
= & a_{0}+a_{1}\frac{x}{1!}+a_{2}\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+a_{3}\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\cdots\\
= & \mathbb{I}\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\left(-\right)^{m}a_{2m}\frac{\left|x\right|^{2m}}{\left(2m\right)!}+\widehat{x}\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\left(-\right)^{m}a_{2m+1}\frac{\left|x\right|^{2m+1}}{\left(2m+1\right)!}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

This is a general formula.
 For the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}=1$
\end_inset

 we just get exp, so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\exp\left(x\right)=\mathbb{I}\cos\left|x\right|+\widehat{x}\sin\left|x\right|
\]

\end_inset

and so the equation we are trying to solve is for find some 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t)$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\cos f(t)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\left(-\right)^{m}a_{2m}\frac{t^{2m}}{\left(2m\right)!}
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sin f(t)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\left(-\right)^{m}a_{2m+1}\frac{t^{2m+1}}{\left(2m+1\right)!}
\]

\end_inset

which is over-constrained, so I did something wrong ...
 So really, the correct eqn is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s(x)=g\left(\left|x\right|\right)\exp\left(f\left(\left|x\right|\right)\widehat{x}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 just rescales the speed of the trajectory, and 
\begin_inset Formula $g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is needed to not overconstrain the problem, as above -- and it is valid,
 because exp is no longer a pure group element, but some matrix representation,
 and so can be validly multiplied by a scalar.
 Which is fine, because we could not take the series expansion, anyway,
 unless we were working with a represetnation, as noted above.
 So the eqns to solve are now: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(t)\cos f(t)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\left(-\right)^{m}a_{2m}\frac{t^{2m}}{\left(2m\right)!}
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(t)\sin f(t)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\left(-\right)^{m}a_{2m+1}\frac{t^{2m+1}}{\left(2m+1\right)!}
\]

\end_inset

And these can now be trivially solved, and are ...
 boring? Depdends on the series 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 I suppose...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, all we got for the fundamental rep of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{su}(2)$
\end_inset

 is that it took a series, split it into even and odd parts, made it alternate,
 and re-assembled it with trig functions.
 Which seems trite ...
 but is it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The adjoint rep is a hot stinking mess.
 Lets work it out.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}=L_{i}$
\end_inset

 the 3D rotation generators, and so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\sum_{k}x_{k}L_{k}=\vec{x}\cdot\vec{L}
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x^{2}=\vec{x}\otimes\vec{x}-\mathbb{I}\left|x\right|^{2}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 is just the 3D component vector and the tensor product is the outer product.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x^{2n}=\left(-\right)^{n}\left|x\right|^{2n-2}\left(\mathbb{I}\left|x\right|^{2}-\vec{x}\otimes\vec{x}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{x}\otimes\vec{x}\;\vec{x}\cdot\vec{L}=0
\]

\end_inset

so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x^{2n+1}=\left(-\right)^{n}\left|x\right|^{2n}\,\vec{x}\cdot\vec{L}
\]

\end_inset

and the series is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s(x)=\mathbb{I}a_{0}+\left(\mathbb{I}\left|x\right|^{2}-\vec{x}\otimes\vec{x}\right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(-\right)^{n}a_{2n}\frac{\left|x\right|^{2n-2}}{\left(2n\right)!}+\vec{x}\cdot\vec{L}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(-\right)^{n}a_{2n+1}\frac{\left|x\right|^{2n}}{\left(2n+1\right)!}
\]

\end_inset

 so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\exp(x)= & \mathbb{I}+\left(\mathbb{I}\left|x\right|^{2}-\vec{x}\otimes\vec{x}\right)\frac{\left(\cos\left|x\right|-1\right)}{\left|x\right|^{2}}+\vec{x}\cdot\vec{L}\frac{\sin\left|x\right|}{\left|x\right|}\\
= & \mathbb{I}\cos\left|x\right|+\widehat{x}\sin\left|x\right|+\widehat{x}\otimes\widehat{x}\left(1-\cos\left|x\right|\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Then, term-by-term equaltiy requires that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
g(t)\cos f(t)= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(-\right)^{n}a_{2n}\frac{t^{2n}}{\left(2n\right)!}\\
g(t)\sin f(t)= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(-\right)^{n}a_{2n+1}\frac{t^{2n+1}}{\left(2n+1\right)!}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

which was a lot of work to obtain the same expression as before.
 Its not obvious that this will always be the case, for all reps? Hmm.
 I guess it had better be.
 The tensor product is presumably coming from the universal enveloping algebra,
 which makes sense, case that is where the reps come from, and the identity
 matrix is the quadratic Casimir invariant.
 So all other reps will be like this, just with more tensor products.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
General Lie groups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How about other Lie groups? The sign and cosine come from the alternating
 sign...
 So I'm confused...
 All Lie groups have a quadratic Casimir invariant, so doesn't this imply
 that the 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}$
\end_inset

 term will always be in the above form, excepting that the identity matrix
 might get some factor in front of it? Same for the odd terms? All that
 I can imagine happening is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-\right)^{n}$
\end_inset

 being replaced by some scale factor ...
 but the sign would still have to alternate, right?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If so, then, indeed, this all gets boring...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only lesson here is that maybe the even and odd alternating series are
 interesting, maybe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think I'm done for now, except for maybe a direct confirmation of the
 hypothesis, e.g for su(3) or something like that.
