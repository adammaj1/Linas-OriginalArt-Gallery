\layout Abstract

Statements about the structure of the Cantor Set can illuminate relationships
 between hyperbolic geometry and the representation of real numbers by dyadic
 fractions and continued fractions.
 In particular, it is intersting to consider the symmetries of the Cantor
 Set, the operator representations of these symmetries, and the Hilbert
 spaces of functions on which these act.
 This is a scrapbook of statements about the Cantor Set, containing some
 old and well known statements, and some new research.
 The goal is to come to a better understanding of the structure of the real
 numbers are.
\layout Abstract

This paper is part of a set of chapters that explore the relationship between
 the real numbers, the modular group, and fractals.

The Cantor Set
\layout Standard

The canonical construction of the Cantor set is to start with the topologically
 closed unit interval, and to progressively remove the open intervals that
 form the middle third of the interval.
 The result is a set with a variety curious topological properties; among
 these, that it is a closed set that is of measure zero, and yet is uncountable.
 
\layout Standard

It is perhaps less commonly known that one can construct the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

fat Cantor sets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 which are true cantor sets, but no longer have a measure of zero.
 The fact Cantor sets are topologically isomorphic to the traditional measure-ze
ro Cantor set, and enjoy all of its properties.
 Let us review the construction of thin and fat Cantor sets.

Thin Cantor Set Construction
\layout Standard

Rather than removing the middle third, consider removing an open segment
 of length 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 centered on the middle of the segment, with 
\begin_inset Formula $0<q<1$
\end_inset 

.
 After removing the first segment, the remaining line segments have a length,
 or measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=1-q$
\end_inset

Hyperbolic Rotations of Binary Trees
\layout Standard

Note that by imposing the modular group symmetry on the real number line,
 we've essentially introduced a hyperbolic manifold that is homomorphic
 to the real-number line.
 The existence of this hyperbolic manifold and its negative curvature essentiall
y 'explains' why trajectories of iterated functions have positive Lyapunov
 exponents.
 Of course they do, since their 'true' trajectories should be considered
 to live on the hyperbolic manifold rather than on the real-number line.
 We try to make this clear below.
 
\layout Standard

One can get a much better sense of the hyperbolic nature induced by this
 symmetry group by looking at the discrete 'rotations' of the binary tree.
 Rotations are frequently used in computer science algorithms to rebalance
 finite binary trees while at the same time preserving the order of the
 elements in the tree.
 We can think of a rotation as kind of like draping the flexible, droopy
 tree over a peg, letting gravity do its job, and declaring the node on
 the peg as the new root of the tree.
 In fact, we have to do a bit of minor surgery to get this right; we have
 to cut a branch and re-attach it at the free spot where the old root used
 to be.
 
\layout Standard

Thus for example, lets rotate the dyadic tree so that the node at 1/4 becomes
 the new root.
 We do this by chopping off the tree rooted at 3/8'ths and re-attaching
 at as the left subtree of the old root at 1/2.
 (xxx we desperately need a diagram here) Denoting this rotation with the
 symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

, we have an isomorphism of trees: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{4}\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)=\frac{1}{8}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\theta\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)=\frac{1}{16}\;\;\;\;\;\theta\left(\frac{3}{8}\right)=\frac{3}{16}\;\;\;\;\;\theta\left(\frac{5}{8}\right)=\frac{3}{8}\;\;\;\;\;\theta\left(\frac{7}{8}\right)=\frac{3}{4}\]

\end_inset 

 and the rest of the tree hanging as normal under these nodes.
 Its not hard to see that this rotation is order-preserving, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(x)<\theta(y)$
\end_inset 

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $x<y$
\end_inset 

 and thus monotonic, one-to-one and onto.
 This is the stretch-and-shrink map
\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
x/2 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 0\leq x\leq1/2\\
x-1/4 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 1/2\leq x\leq3/4\\
2x-1 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 3/4\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

 which is stretching in one interval and shrinking in another.
 Since we've seen that the Modular Group maps intervals to intervals, some
 stretching and some shrinking, we immediately recognize that three group
 elements were used to construct this map.
 Since we've already enumerated the modular group in terms of maps of intervals,
 we see that the three different group elements making up this map are the
 one that re-parented the 1/8 tree at 1/4, the 3/8 tree at 5/8 and the 3/4
 tree at 7/8.
 In terms of tree surgery, it is enough to specify these three remapings,
 as the rest of the binary trees hanging below are structurally unaltered.
 Note that the 3/8'ths to 5/8'ths mapping does not change the denominator:
 this map neither stretches nor shrinks, its a lateral translation.
 
\layout Standard

Note that the map is clearly invertible, with its inverse being 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta^{-1}(x)=xxx\]

\end_inset 

 Notice that the shrinking portion of the map is just the inverse of the
 stretching portion of the map.
 Iterating these maps just makes them even more hyperbolic.
 Figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Theta Maps}

 shows some of these.

This figure shows

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=-1$
\end_inset 

 and positive 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 up to 7.
 Marker-points highlight the endpoints of the straight line segments that
 make up each of these maps.
 Note that these maps are symmetric around the 
\begin_inset Formula $y=1-x$
\end_inset 

 line, and that the endpoints of each segment lie on the hyperbola 
\begin_inset Formula $xy=2^{-n-2}$
\end_inset 

, with the exception of the endpoints at 0 and 1.
 Since each map contains more segments, each map becomes a better approximation
 to the hyperbola.
 
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The reflection map 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x)=1-x$
\end_inset 

 conjugates 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

 to its inverse, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $r\theta^{n}r=\theta^{-n}$
\end_inset 

 .
 
\layout Standard

We demonstrate a more complex mapping by rebalancing the binary tree so
 that the 3/8 node becomes root.
 This requires two tree movements: switching the 7/16 node so that it lives
 under 1/2, and switching the 5/16 node so that it lives under the now empty
 slot at 1/4.
 This is shown in the diagram (xxx need to create the pretty-picture of
 the rotated tree xxx).
 This rotation is given by the mapping 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\eta(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
x & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 0\leq x\leq1/4\\
x/2+1/8 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 1/4\leq x\leq3/4\\
2x-1 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 3/4\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\]

Looking at these, it becomes clear that one can insert hyperbolas wherever
 one wishes, as long as the resulting map is monotonically increasing.
 
\layout Standard

And so we can see the negative curvature.
 we also have an explicit metric on this space.
 Note that this in turn induces a metric on the Stern-Brocot Tree.
 We can consider the path of 'geodesics' under this map, say of iterating
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

over and over.
 clearly these 'geodesics' separate.
\layout Standard

Note that this is essentially a model of two-dimensional space-time, where
 the Lorentz transformations are given by elements of the modular group.
\layout Standard

We of course are now begging to ask about 3+1 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

spacetime
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 generated by the complex numbers, (xxx this is actually called the Picard
 group see Fricke and Klien, circa 1897.) which is generated by 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,ZxZ)$
\end_inset 

 which is a subgroup of 
\begin_inset Formula $GL(2,C)$
\end_inset 

.
 Studying how rotations work on this manifold would be interesting, as well
 as defining precisely its relation to Minkowski spacetime.xxx move this
 to the todo-list.
 Higher dimensional manifolds seem to be generated by quaternions and the
 octonians.
 We also can't help but take a general pot-shot and exclaim 'of course quantum
 mechanics is chaotic: Hamiltonian evolution takes place on a fundamentally
 hyperbolic manifold, viz.
 the Minkowski spacetime'.
 The wave functions will of course be fractal.
 In some freaky way, this is also why we get quantization: we don't truly
 have the general symmetries, we have instead interval-mapping symmetries
 that are limited to a discrete (but infinite) set of intervals.
