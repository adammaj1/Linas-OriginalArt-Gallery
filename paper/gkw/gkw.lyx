\layout Abstract

The study of the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing (GKW) operator can provide insight
 into the structure of the Riemann Zeta function, as the Zeta is a laplace-like
 transform of the GKW.
 Unfortunately, it is quite complex itself, and appears very difficult to
 solve.
 This chapter applies some tools developed for the study of fractals, and
 thier symmetries, to discuss and solve some related operators.
 
\layout Abstract

Specifically, the Minkowski Question Mark Function is an isomorphism connecting
 the dyadic (binary) fractions and the Farey Fractions.
 The Question Mark embodies the basic Modular Group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

 symmetries seen in the dyadic and Farey Trees, and thus seen in fractals.
 This implies that GKW should have a set of modular-group symmetries as
 well, which in turn might extend onto the Riemann Zeta.
 
\layout Abstract

This chapter develops some of the tools for studying chaotic maps, spcifically
 the idea of studying the Frobenius-Perron (FP) operator of a chaotic map.
 The FP operator of the map that generates continued fractions is the GKW.
 We thus apply the modular group symmetries of the continued fractions to
 study the GKW.
 
\layout Abstract

The general presentation attempts to assume very little prior acquaintance
 with the concepts, and attempts a pedagogical aproach.
 This paper is part of a set of chapters that explore the relationship between
 the real numbers, the modular group, and fractals.

Introduction: The Frobenius-Perron Operator for Iterated Maps
\layout Standard

This section provides a basic review of the Frobenius-Perron operator and
 its use in the description of fractals and chaotic iterated maps.
 No results are presented here; rather the goal is to provide the background
 for later sections.
 
\layout Standard

The Frobenius-Perron operator of a function provides a tool for studying
 the dynamics of the iteration of that function.
 If one only studies how a point value jumps around during iteration, one
 gets a very good sense of the point dynamics but no sense of how iteration
 acts on non-point sets.
 If the iterated function is applied on a continuous, possibly even smooth
 density, then one wants to know how that smooth density evolves over repeated
 iteration.
 
\layout Standard

If we consider a smooth density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset 

 as a set of values on a collection of points, we can take each point and
 iterate it to find its new location, and then assign the old value to the
 new location.
 Of course, after iteration, several points may end up at the same location,
 at which point we need to add thier values together.
 Lets write the new density as 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}(x)$
\end_inset 

, with the subscript 1 denoting we've iterated once.
 We can express this idea of iterating the underlying points, and then assigning
 thier old values to new locations as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\rho_{1}(x)=\int dy\;\delta\left(x-g(y)\right)\;\rho(y)\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the iterated function.
 To get 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{n}(x)$
\end_inset 

, one simply repeats the proceedure 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 times.
 In more abstract notation, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{g}\rho\right](x)=\rho_{1}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 to denote this time evolution.
 The notation here emphasizes that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}:\; f\mapsto U_{g}f$
\end_inset 

 is an operator that maps functions to functions: written formally, we have
 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}:\mathcal{F\mathcal{\rightarrow F}}$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}=\left\{ f\;|\; f:\mathbb{\mathbb{R\rightarrow}R}\right\} $
\end_inset 

 is the set of all functions.
 In analyzing 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

, we will often be interested in how it acts on the subset of square-integrable
 functions, or possibly just 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\infty}$
\end_inset 

 functions or polynomials or the like.
 Repeated iteration just gives the time-evolution of the the density; that
 is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
U_{g}^{n}\rho\equiv\begin{array}{c}
\underbrace{U_{g}\circ U_{g}\circ...\circ U_{g}}\\
n\textrm{ times}\end{array}\;\circ\rho=\rho_{n}\]

\end_inset 

 where iteration is just ordinary operator multiplication.
 
\layout Standard

To understand 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

, one typically tries to understand its spectrum, that is, its eigenvalues
 and eigenfunctions.
 In most cases, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 is contractive in that it has one eigenvalue equal to one and all the other
 eigenvalues are real and smaller than one.
 However, one must be terribly careful here, as there are land-mines strewn
 about: the actual spectrum, and the nature of the eigenvalues, depends
 very much on the function space choosen.
 Typically, when acting on polynomials, one gets discrete, real eigenvalues
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

.
 When acting on square-integrable functions, one seems to usually get a
 continuous set of complex-valued eigenvalues.
 This is because one can often find shift-states 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{n}$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}\psi_{n}=\psi_{n-1}$
\end_inset 

, in which case one can construct eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(z)=\sum_{n}z^{n}\psi_{n}$
\end_inset 

 whose complex eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 form the unit disk.
 It is often considered to be a mistake to try to analyse 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 acting on a finite grid of discrete points, such as one might try on a
 computer: it is all to easy to turn this into an excercise of analysing
 the permutation group on a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

 elements, of which any student knows that the eigenvalues are the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

'th roots of unity.
 
\layout Standard

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 is a linear operator, it induces a homomorphism in its mapping, and so
 one should study its kernel 
\begin_inset Formula $Ker\; U_{g}=\left\{ f\;|\; U_{g}f=0\right\} $
\end_inset 

 to gain insights into its symmetry as well as to express more correctly
 the quotient space.
 Insofar as the iterated map might represent a dynamical system, one knows
 that symmetries lead to conserved currents, via Noether's theorm, and sometimes
 to topologically-conserved (quantum) numbers, winding numbers or other
 invarients.
 
\layout Standard

Finally, we note that since 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 looks like a time-evolution operator, we are tempted to write
\begin_inset Formula \[
U_{g}^{t}=\exp\; tH_{g}\]

\end_inset 

 for some other operator 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{g}$
\end_inset 

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

 is in general not unitary, 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset 

 is not (anti-)Hermitian.
 As before, describing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset 

 is a useful excercise.
 Also, any group of symmetries on 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

 should express themselves as an algebra on 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset 

 and these might provide an alternate path for exploring and describing
 the fractal in question.
\layout Standard

In practice, when one is given an iterated map 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset 

, one computes the Frobenius-Perron operator as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{g}\rho\right](x)=\sum_{x':x=g(x')}\frac{\rho(x')}{\left|dg(x')/dx'\right|}\]

\end_inset 

 which provides an expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 acting on a general function 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset 

.
 If one is interested in 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

 acting on polynomial or 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\infty}$
\end_inset 

 functions, then one immediately writes the Taylor (or McLauren) series
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\rho(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\rho^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^{n}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}x^{n}\]

\end_inset 

 and substitutes this in to get the matrix form of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U\rho\right](x)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}b_{m}x^{m}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}x^{m}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}U_{mn}a_{n}\]

\end_inset 

 Equating each power of 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{m}$
\end_inset 

 we get 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\frac{1}{m!}\;\frac{d^{m}\left[U\rho\right](x)}{dx^{m}}\right|_{x=0}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}U_{mn}\left.\frac{1}{n!}\;\frac{d^{n}\rho(x)}{dx^{n}}\right|_{x=0}\]

\end_inset 

 as the matrix equation for the transformation of polynomials, expressed
 in classical notation.
 
\layout Standard

There are a variety of different notations that one can use when working
 with matrix operators, all of which are, at a certain level, completely
 equivalent.
 However, certain notations are handier than others depending on what representa
tion one is working with, and what point one is trying to emphasize.
 Note in particular that the Dirac bra-ket notation is both very useful,
 and is also sometimes a source for confusion, especially when mixed with
 other notations.
 Thus, in the following, we take some pains to clarify this notation, giving
 a prolonged remedial presentation.
 (XXX this should be moved to an apendix).
\layout Standard

The operator, written in the polynomial representation, in space coordinates,
 is:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\left(g(x)-y\right)=U_{g}(x,y)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x|m\right\rangle \left\langle m|U_{g}|n\right\rangle \left\langle n|y\right\rangle \]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{mn}=\left\langle m|U|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x|m\right\rangle =x^{m}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n|y\right\rangle =(-)^{n}\delta^{(n)}(y)/n!$
\end_inset 

, the latter being the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

'th derivative of the Dirac delta function.
 In this basis, 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset 

 is not diagonal, and the kets 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset 

 are not eigenvectors, and the vector element 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x|m\right\rangle $
\end_inset 

 is neither the complex conjugate nor the transpose of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n|y\right\rangle $
\end_inset 

.
 These are rather monomials and thier inverses, and obey traditional orthogonali
ty and completeness relationships.
 The inner products demonstrate orthogonality: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left\langle n|m\right\rangle  & = & \int dx\left\langle n|x\right\rangle \left\langle x|m\right\rangle \\
 & = & \int dx\,(-)^{n}\frac{\delta^{(n)}(x)}{n!}x^{m}\\
 & = & \delta_{nm}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left\langle x|y\right\rangle  & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x|n\right\rangle \left\langle n|y\right\rangle \\
 & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-x)^{n}\frac{\delta^{(n)}(y)}{n!}\\
 & = & \delta(y-x)\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 are the orthogonality relationships in polynomial space and coordinate
 space, respectively.
 The completeness relationships define the identity operator 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbb{I}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|n\right\rangle \left\langle n\right|=\int dx\left|x\right\rangle \left\langle x\right|\]

\end_inset 

 whose matrix elements in coordinate space are 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x\right|\mathbb{I}\left|y\right\rangle =\delta(y-x)$
\end_inset 

 and, in polynomial space, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle m\right|\mathbb{I}\left|n\right\rangle =\delta_{mn}$
\end_inset 

.
 In this notation, a function is represented by it's Taylor series: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
f(x) & = & \left\langle x|f\right\rangle \\
 & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x|n\right\rangle \left\langle n|f\right\rangle \\
 & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{n}\left\langle n|f\right\rangle \\
 & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{n}\int dy\left\langle n|y\right\rangle \left\langle y|f\right\rangle \\
 & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{n}\int dy(-)^{n}\frac{\delta^{(n)}(y)}{n!}f(y)\\
 & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{n}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Lets complete the review by taking the coordinate-sapce representation of
 the Frobenius-Perron operator back to its matrix representation.
 Integrating the coordinate-space operator representation over 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

, we regain the previous expressions for the operator in Hilbert space:
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{multline*}
\left[U_{g}\rho\right](x)=\int dy\; U_{g}(x,y)\rho(y)\end{multline*}

\end_inset 

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
=\int dy\;\delta\left(g(x)-y\right)\rho(y)\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
=\sum_{m,n=0}^{\infty}\; x^{m}\; U_{mn}\int dy\;(-)^{n}\frac{\delta^{(n)}(y)}{n!}\rho(y)\]

\end_inset 

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
=\sum_{m,n=0}^{\infty}\; x^{m}\; U_{mn}\left.\frac{1}{n!}\;\frac{d^{n}\rho(y)}{dy^{n}}\right|_{y=0}\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
=\sum_{m,n=0}^{\infty}\; x^{m}\; U_{mn}\;\frac{\rho^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\]

\end_inset 

 Note that when one goes to diagonalize the operator, one will find 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

right eigenvectors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 that will consist solely of a linear combinatation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x|m\right\rangle =x^{m}$
\end_inset 

 , that is, will be plynomials.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

left eigenstates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 will, by definition, be a linear combination solely of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n|y\right\rangle =(-)^{n}\delta^{(n)}(y)/n!$
\end_inset 

 since, in a polynomial Hilbert space, these are the basis functions that
 are adjoint to polynomials.
\layout Standard

It is critical to understand that the above notation and conventions are
 applicable only to the polynomial representation, and by construction,
 yeilds discrete spectra and polynomial (analytic, 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\infty}$
\end_inset 

) eigenfunctions.
 This representation is more-or-less incapable of doing otherwise.
 The above expressions, although constructed using an equals sign, in fact
 do a great deal of violence and are in a certain way violently incorrect,
 because they hide or incorrectly equate the function spaces on which the
 operator 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 acts.
 That is, whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset 

 is not differentiable or is otherwise singular, the expansion in derivatives
 is not justified.
 As we will see shortly, when considered as acting in the space of square-integr
able functions, 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset 

 can and will have fractal eigenfunctions, which will typically be non-different
iable and even possibly continuous-nowhere, and thus not representable by
 polynomials.
 This is, of course, the whole point of this excercise!
\layout Standard

If one is very lucky, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{mn}$
\end_inset 

 is upper-triangular, in which case it can be solved immediately for its
 eigenfunctions, and its eigenvalues already lie on the diagonal.
 We will find that we get lucky in this way for the Bernoulli operator,
 and for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

singular sawtooth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 operator, but not for the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator.
 Of course, it is known that a complete solution of the GKW should lead
 directly to a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, so getting lucky would be
 truly lucky indeed.

The Frobenius-Perron Operator of the Bernoulli Map
\layout Standard

The Bernoulli map is an exactly solvable example of deterministic chaos.
 A thorough exposition of this map is provided in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-2}

\end_inset 

, and we recap here only insofar as it gives a simple example of some of
 the more subtle upcoming issues.
\layout Standard

The Bernoulli map is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b(x)=2x-\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor \]

\end_inset 

 and can be thought of as poping the leading digit off of the binary expansion
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $x.$
\end_inset 

 This map has a positive Lyapunov exponent and is highly chaotic, as, in
 a certain sense, one can say that the digits of the binary expansion of
 some 'arbitrary' number are 'unpredicatable', and that the orbits of two
 close-by numbers will eventually become 'uncorellated' (after suitably
 defining what we mean by 'arbitrary' and 'unpredictable').
 
\layout Standard

The Frobenius-Perron operator of the Bernoulli map is given by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{B}f\right](x)=\frac{1}{2}\left[f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+f\left(\frac{x+1}{2}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset 

 Note that the the iterated tent map behaves sort-of like a shift state,
 in that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{B}\tau^{k}\right](x)=\tau^{k-1}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 although it does not terminate properly for a shift state: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{B}\tau\right](x)=\frac{1}{2}\]

\end_inset 

 (a true shift state would vanish on the final iteration).
 We see that the Takagi curve transforms as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{B}t_{w}\right](x)=1-\frac{w}{2}+wt_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 under the Bernoullli operator.
\layout Standard

Blah blah blah.
 How much more here do we want to say? 
\layout Subsection

The Polynomial Representation
\layout Standard

Well, Provide the matrix elements.
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{B}\right]_{mk}\equiv U_{mk}\equiv\left\langle m\right|U\left|k\right\rangle =\frac{\delta_{mk}}{2^{m}}+\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
m\end{array}\right)\frac{\Theta_{mk}}{2^{k+1}}\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\begin{array}{c}
m\\
k\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset 

 is the binomial coefficient, and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Theta_{mk}=\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
0\;\textrm{ if }\; k\leq m\\
1\;\textrm{ if }\; k>m\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

 is a traceless, pure upper-triangular matrix.
 Thus, for the polynomial eigenstates, we can promptly read the eigenvalues
 off the diagonal; these eigenvalues are 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}=2^{-n}$
\end_inset 

.
 Because the matrix is upper-triangular, it is easily solvable for both
 the left and right eigenvectors, which agree perfectly w/ Driebe.
 
\layout Standard

The right eigenvectors are denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|B_{n}\right\rangle $
\end_inset 

 and have the vector components 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle k|B_{n}\right\rangle =\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(1-\Theta_{n,k}\right)B_{n-k}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)B_{n-k} & \;\textrm{ for }\; & k\leq n\\
0 & \;\textrm{ for }\; & k>n\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{k}$
\end_inset 

 are the Bernoulli numbers.
 We can verify this by multiplying the eigenvector into the matrix: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left\langle m\right|U\left|k\right\rangle \left\langle k|B_{n}\right\rangle  & = & \sum_{k=m}^{n}\left[\frac{\delta_{mk}}{2^{m}}+\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
m\end{array}\right)\frac{\Theta_{mk}}{2^{k+1}}\right]\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)B_{n-k}\\
 & = & \frac{1}{2^{m}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
m\end{array}\right)B_{n-m}+...non-trivial-taylor-expn\\
 & = & \lambda_{n}\left\langle m|B_{n}\right\rangle \end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 In coordinate space, the right eigenvectors are the Bernoulli polynomials.
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x|k\right\rangle \left\langle k|B_{n}\right\rangle =\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)B_{n-k}x^{k}=B_{n}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 which we can verify explicitly by substituting into the function-operator
 form of the map:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left[U_{B}B_{n}\right](x) & = & \frac{1}{2}\left[B_{n}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+B_{n}\left(\frac{x+1}{2}\right)\right]\\
 & = & \lambda_{n}B_{n}(x)\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 The last identity follows from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

multiplication formula
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for Bernoulli polynomials.
\layout Standard

The left eigenvectors are denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}\right|$
\end_inset 

and, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n>0$
\end_inset 

, have the components 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}|k\right\rangle =\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
n-1\end{array}\right)\frac{1}{n}\left(\delta_{nk}+\Theta_{nk}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 The zero'th left eigenvector is a special-case; it has components 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \tilde{B}_{0}|k\right\rangle =1/(k+1)$
\end_inset 

.
 The left eigenvectors can also be written out in coordinate space: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}|x\right\rangle  & = & \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}|k\right\rangle \left\langle k|x\right\rangle \\
 & = & \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}|k\right\rangle (-)^{k}\frac{\delta^{(k)}(x)}{k!}\\
 & = & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=n}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
n-1\end{array}\right)(-)^{k}\frac{\delta^{(k)}(x)}{k!}\\
 & = & \frac{(-)^{n+1}}{n!}\left[\delta^{(n-1)}(1-x)-\delta^{(n-1)}(x)\right]\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $n>0$
\end_inset 

case.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0$
\end_inset 

 left eigenvector is best understood by integrating it over some arbitrary
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{0}^{1}dx\,\left\langle \tilde{B}_{0}|x\right\rangle f(x) & = & \int_{0}^{1}dx\, f(x)\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-)^{k}\frac{\delta^{(k)}(x)}{(k+1)!}\\
 & = & \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{(k+1)!}\\
 & = & \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\int_{0}^{1}x^{k}dx\\
 & = & \int_{0}^{1}f(x)dx\\
 & = & \left\langle \tilde{B}_{0}|f\right\rangle \end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 Its instructive to look at the other left eignvectors acting on some function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

; these can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}|f\right\rangle =\frac{1}{n!}\left[f^{(n-1)}(1)-f^{(n-1)}(0)\right]\]

\end_inset 

Note that the left eigenvectors are adjoint ot the Bernoulli polynomials.
 Thus, the identity operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|B_{n}\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}\right|$
\end_inset 

turns out to be the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula in disguise, which
 we can see more easily by writing 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
f(x) & = & \left\langle x|f\right\rangle \\
 & = & \sum_{m=0}^{M}B_{m}(x)\left\langle \tilde{B}_{m}|f\right\rangle -\frac{1}{M!}\int_{0}^{1}dy\, B_{M}(x-y)\; f^{(M)}(y)\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 Its not to hard to explicitly compute completeness: one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula \[

The Kernel
\layout Standard

What is the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{B}$
\end_inset 

? It is the set of functions that have odd symmetry.
 This implies that 'half' of all square-integrable functions are in the
 kernel.
 This is a huge space.
 The quotient space of the implied isomorphism thus has the Bernoulli polynomial
s as the representative elements.
 This is I think the correct way to relate coordinate space to the Hilbert
 space, is by means of the quotient space generated by the kernel of the
 time-evolution operator.
 This provides the isomorphisms, and any other square-integrable function
 is thus expandable as a linear combination of the polynomial eigenfunctions
 plus the kernel.
 Talk about 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset 

 and its spectrum.
 Symmetry symmetry talk about the symmetry group of the kernel.
 
\layout Subsection

The Continuous Spectrum
\layout Standard

The continuous-spectrum eigenfunctions of the Bernoulli map are of course
 a generalizastion of the Takagi-Landsberg curve to complex values.
 These eigenfunctions are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\phi_{z,l}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^{n}\exp\left(2\pi i\;2^{n}\left(2l+1\right)x\right)\]

\end_inset 

 which have eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

: that is 
\begin_inset Formula $[U_{B}\phi_{z,l}](x)=z\phi_{z,l}(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 These are quite beautiful fractals (xxx provide a picture here).
 Symmetry is the name of the game here.
 
\layout Standard

These are protype forms for and the famous and beautiful Levy Dragons (reference
 the Paul Levy 1938 paper here) (actually Levy was trying to generalize
 the Koch curves).
 
\layout Standard

Note that when we go to look at the tesselatation of the hyperbolic plane
 by the hyperbolic triangle under the symmetry of the modular group, I think
 we get the tesselation of the plane with Levy's Dragons, which I think
 is the point that Paul Levy was trying to make.
 So this fits all very nicely: we have a direct 1-1 correspondance between
 tesselations on the hyperplane with tessalations of real space by fractal
 curves.
 It is sufficient to talk about one to talk about the other.
\layout Standard

This also means that Bournoulli map also makes for a good toy example of
 quantum chaos.
 In quantum chaos, the eigenfunctions must form a complete set in the sense
 that for any given point in space, there must exist at least one eigenfunction
 that is non-vanishing on that point.
 In other words, the eigenfunctions of a quantum-chaotic system must tesselate
 the space in which they live.
 The toy example of this kind of tesselation is the Levy Dragon.

 In this section, we will study a model for this function, where we replace

This sawtooth function joins values of

\end_inset

\end_inset 

 The Frobenius-Perron operator for this function is exactly solvable, and
 provides a toy model of the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator.
 The Frobenius-Perron operator of this sawtooth, acting on a general function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

, is given by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{w}f\right](x)=\sum_{x':w(x')=x}\frac{f(x')}{\left|dw(x')/dx'\right|}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}f\left(\frac{n+1-x}{n(n+1)}\right)\]

\end_inset 

We develop a representation of this operator in the polynomial-basis Hilbert
 space below.
\layout Subsection

The Polynomial Eigenfunctions
\layout Standard

We will want to consider the action of this operator on polynomials of 
\begin_inset Formula $y=1-x$
\end_inset 

, so that we can express 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

 as a Taylor's expansion about 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset 

.
 Lets make this change-of-variable now, and write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(y)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}y^{k}\equiv\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}y^{k}\]

\end_inset 

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{w}f\right](y)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}b_{k}y^{k}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}\left(\frac{n+y}{n(n+1)}\right)^{k}\]

\end_inset 

 Rarranging the sums, and equating terms with the same power of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

, we define the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{mk}$
\end_inset 

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b_{m}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}W_{mk}a_{k}\]

\end_inset 

 and find that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
W_{mk}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
m\end{array}\right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-m-1}(n+1)^{-k-1} & \;\textrm{ for \;} & k\geq m\\
0 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & k<m\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

 where we use 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
m\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset 

 to denote the binomial coefficient.
 This matrix is upper-triangular, and thus has its eigenvalues along the
 diagonal.
 These are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda_{k}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{k+1}(n+1)^{k+1}}\]

\end_inset 

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=1$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=2\zeta(2)-3$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the Riemann zeta.
 Numerically, we can see that the first few eigenvalues are 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=0.289868...$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=0.130396...$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{3}=0.0633278...$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{4}=0.031383...$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{5}=0.0156468...$
\end_inset 

 We can trivialy see that the ratio of eigenvalues settles down to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{k}/\lambda_{k+1}=2$
\end_inset 

 for large 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

, since the first term of the sum will dominate for large 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

We can solve the operator through recursion on the matrix elements of a
 related operator, by observing that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
Z_{mk}\equiv\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{m}(n+1)^{k}}\left[\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}\right]=Z_{m,k-1}-Z_{m-1,k}\]

\end_inset 

 These recurrance relations are bounded on the edges by 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{00}=1$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{01}=2-\zeta(2)$
\end_inset 

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
Z_{0k} &  & =Z_{0,k-1}-\left(\zeta(k+1)-1\right)=1-\sum_{j=1}^{k}\left[\zeta(j+1)-1\right]\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{10}=\zeta(2)-1$
\end_inset 

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
Z_{m0}=\zeta(m+1)-Z_{m-1,0}=(-)^{m}\left[1+\sum_{j=1}^{m}(-)^{j}\zeta(j+1)\right]\]

\end_inset 

 and we have 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{mk}=W_{mk}$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $m\leq k$
\end_inset 

 .
 The first few eigenfunctions are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e_{0}(y)=1\]

\end_inset 

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e_{1}(y)=1-2y\]

\end_inset 

 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
e_{2}(y) & = & \frac{15-13\zeta(2)-9\zeta(3)+2\zeta(2)[\zeta(2)+3\zeta(3)]}{3(13\zeta(2)-8\zeta(3))(3-2\zeta(2))}+\\
 &  & +y\;\frac{6\zeta(2)+2\zeta(3)-12}{13-8\zeta(2)}+y^{2}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 We can quickly see that although the eigenfunctions are polynomials and
 are exactly solvable, they quickly spiral out of control.

The Failure of the Similarity Transform for the Polynomial Basis
\layout Standard

Under normal circumstances, whenever one has a pair of maps 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x)$
\end_inset 

 that are conjugate to each other through an invertible function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(x)$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)=(\phi\circ\beta\circ\phi^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset 

, then there exists a similarity transform 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}$
\end_inset 

 such that the Frobenius-Perron operators are also conjugate; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{\alpha}=S_{\phi}U_{\beta}S_{\phi}^{-1}$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}^{-1}=S_{\phi^{-1}}$
\end_inset 

.
 Formally, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}=1/(\phi'\circ\phi^{-1})$
\end_inset 

 where the prime denotes differentiation: 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi'(x)=d\phi(x)/dx$
\end_inset 

 .
 Since the continued-fraction shift function is conjugate to the sawtooth,
 one might hope that GKW would be conjugate to 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{C}$
\end_inset 

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{h}=S_{?}U_{C}S_{?}^{-1}$
\end_inset 

.
 Unfortunately, the Minkowski Question Mark is highly singular and is not
 traditionally differentiable, and so we cannot build such a similarity
 transform using the polynomial function basis.
 Another way to deduce this is to note that the similarity transform 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}$
\end_inset 

, working as a traditional, ordinary operator, normally preserves the eigenvalue
s; that is, the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{\alpha}$
\end_inset 

 equal those of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{\beta}$
\end_inset 

.
 In the current case, we see trouble in that the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{C}$
\end_inset 

 are not those of GKW.
 They are not even 'close', in that the ratio of tends to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{k}/\lambda_{k+1}=2$
\end_inset 

 whereas for the GKW the ratio is 2.65...
 I am not aware of what this value is supposed to be.
 Its plausible that it may be Khinchin's constant 2.685.
 But given the intricate connection between the Riemann Zeta, the Modular
 Group, and period-doubling fractals, its equally plausible is that it may
 be Feigenbaum's constant, the ratio of period doubling 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=4.6692...$
\end_inset 

 which is 2+2.6692...
\layout Standard

However, there are suggestive elements.
 For example, the function argument 
\begin_inset Formula $(2-x)/2^{n}$
\end_inset 

 is just the dyadic polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $(g_{D}^{n-1}r_{D}g_{D})(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 Tantalizingly, the correspondig Mobius transform is 
\begin_inset Formula $(g_{C}^{n-1}r_{C}g_{C})(x)=1/(n+x)$
\end_inset 

 which is the function argument to the GKW operator.
 This suggests the tantalizing re-write of the terms of GKW as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)=f\circ?^{-1}\left(\frac{2-?(x)}{2^{n}}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Also, one can do strange things such as xxx but why do we want to do that?
\layout Standard

The point is to not give up hope on the operator relationships, even though
 the polynomial basis breaks the relationship.
 Thus, we are motivated to explore other bases, and not just the polynomial
 basis.
 Fortunately, we can find some of these.

Fractal Eigenfunctions of the Second Sawtooth
\layout Standard

The Takagi curve can be used to build an alternate set of eigenfunctions
 for the seco
\layout Standard

nd sawtooth, posessing continuous-spectrum eigenvalues.
 These eigenfunctions are not differentiable, and thus cannot be obtained
 through polynomials, and thus are not visible when working with the operator
 in a polynomial-basis Hilbert Space.
 They can be used to build an alternate function space, in which the Second
 Sawtooth remains exactly solvable.
 
\layout Standard

We recognize from the studying of the dyadic representation of the Modular
 Group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

 that the second sawtooth is expressed in terms of the the group element
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[g_{D}^{k-1}r_{D}g_{D}\right](x)=\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}-\frac{x}{2^{k}}\]

\end_inset 

 adn thus functions posessing the modular group symmetry are candidates
 for solving the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{C}$
\end_inset 

.
 The candidates we have in mind are of course the family of Takagi Curves.
 
\layout Standard

We begin by defining the Takagi Curve as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\tau\left(2^{k}x-\left\lfloor 2^{k}x\right\rfloor \right)\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the triangle wave: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
2x & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 0\leq x\leq1/2\\
2(1-x) & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

 This form of the Takagi curve transforms under the three-dimensional representa
tion of the Modular Group.
 Specifically, we write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{3}^{n}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1/2^{n} & 0\\
0 & q_{n}(w) & w\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}(w)$
\end_inset 

 is the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula \[
q_{n}(w)=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\sum_{k-0}^{n-1}(2w)^{k}=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\left(\frac{1-(2w)^{n}}{1-2w}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 We write out the full matrix form for 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{3}^{k-1}r_{3}g_{3}$
\end_inset 

 and apply the group action isomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}g_{D}^{k-1}r_{D}g_{D}=g_{3}^{k-1}r_{3}g_{3}t_{w}$
\end_inset 

 to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}-\frac{x}{2^{k}}\right)=q_{k-1}(w)+x\left(w^{k-1}-q_{k-1}(w)/2\right)+w^{k}t_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 Inserting the above back into the definition for the sawtooth operator,
 and performing the sum, we get
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[U_{C}t_{w}\right](x)=\frac{4}{3(2-w)}+\frac{x}{3(2-w)}+\frac{wt_{w}(x)}{2-w}\]

\end_inset 

 From this, we can immediately read off the eigenvalue as 
\begin_inset Formula $w/(2-w)$
\end_inset 

.
 To get the eigenfunction, we need to complete the diagonalization by using
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[U_{C}1\right](x)=1$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[U_{C}x\right](x)=(2-x)/3$
\end_inset 

 to get the eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula \[
E_{2}(x)=\frac{2-w}{2(w+1)(w-1)}+\frac{x}{2(w+1)}+t_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset 

 It should be clear from this presentation that the higher and lower dimensional
 Takagi curves, of both even and odd parity, give eigenvectors and eigenvalues
 as well.
 We present a few more here:

Other Trees of Rationals
\layout Standard

Recall that we were able to construct other trees that are isomorphic to
 the Stern-Brocot tree by passing the values in the Stern-Brocot Tree through
 a ratio of polynomials, thus mapping rationals to rationals.
 Monotonically-increasing functions will always perserve monotonicity of
 the question mark.
 Other mappings, such as the cubic 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{3}-x$
\end_inset 

, are in general not globally monotonic, but they are always locally monotonic.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $?((2x-1)^{3}-x+1)$
\end_inset 

 is montonic between the same regions that 
\begin_inset Formula $(2x-1)^{3}-x+1$
\end_inset 

 is, and thus it does not yeild a fundamentally new function.
 Thus, these ploynomial-based mappings of rationals into rationals do not
 generate another self-similar map, they are distorted versions of the Minkowski
 question mark.
\layout Standard

Here's a mapping that is continuous and is also fractally non-monotonic
 (and is thus self-similar): its 
\begin_inset Formula $x-?(x)$
\end_inset 

 which looks sine-like and we want to exhibit the cosine-like so that we
 can build up fractally-periodic basis functions.
