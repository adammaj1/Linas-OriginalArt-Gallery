\begin_layout Abstract
This paper presents an brief review of the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing (GKW) operator.
 The GKW operator is the transfer operator of the Gauss map, and thus has
 connections to the theory of continued fractions -- specifically, it is
 the shift operator for continued fractions.
 The operator appears to have a reasonably smooth, well-behaved structure,
 however, no analytic solutions are known, and do not seem easy to obtain.
 Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be obtained numerically, but little
 else is known in the mathematical literature.
 The review given here is incomplete; it is a diary of research results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
A few connections to the Minkowski Question Mark Function are probed.
 In particular, the Question Mark is used to define a transfer operator
 which is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

topologically equivalent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the GKW.
 This 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

equivalent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operator is solvable, and can be shown to have fractal eigenfunctions.
 However, the spectrum of this operator is not at all the same as that of
 the GKW.
 This is because the Jacobian of the transformation relating the two is
 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $(?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1})$
\end_inset

(x) , which is well-known as the prototypical

\begin_layout Abstract
The presentation given here assumes no math background beyond basic analytic
 function theory.
 This paper is part of a set of chapters that explore the relationship between
 the real numbers, the modular group, and fractals.

\begin_layout Section
The Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing Operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This text is a diary of ongoing research results.
 As such, it is somewhat disorganized.
 It is only sporadically updated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general layout is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Present the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator, including basic facts, theorems,
 relationships.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Show that the Minkowksi Question Mark converts the GKW into a sawtooth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Solve the two sawtooth transfer operators (these are exactly solvable).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing Operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The map that that acts as the shift operator for continued fractions is
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
h(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor \label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, if one writes out the continued-fraction expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x=\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}+\frac{1}{a_{3}+\cdots}}}\equiv\left[a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\cdots\right]\]

\end_inset

then one has that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
h(x)=\left[a_{2},a_{3},\cdots\right]\]

\end_inset

whence the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shift operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This map is often called the Gauss Map.
 Note that shift operators, as linear operators, are studied as a subtopic
 of Banach theory, and often appear in applied mathematics texts devoted
 to the engineering topics of control theory, stability theory and filter
 design
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Part2004"

\end_inset

.
 However, in these texts, shift operators are typically applied to sequences
 of functions defined on Hardy spaces.
 It appears that the shift as applied to continued fractions is very nearly
 unstudied -- and no wonder -- it appears nearly intractable when approached
 with standard analytic tools.

\begin_layout Standard
The Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron or transfer operator associated with the Gauss
 map is known as the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing (GKW)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kuzmin1928,Wirsing1974"

\end_inset

 operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}$
\end_inset

.
 It is the pushback of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, and as such, is a linear map between spaces of functions on the unit interval
 (topological vector spaces).
 That is, given the vector space of functions from the closed unit interval
 to the real numbers 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{F}=\left\{ f\,|\, f:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}\right\} \]

\end_inset

then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}$
\end_inset

 is a linear operator mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 .
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

, it is represented by 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}f\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{2}}f\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)\label{eq:sum-form}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This operator has not been 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

solved
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in the sense that there is no known closed-form analytic solution expressing
 its all of its eigenfunctions and eigenvectors.
 There is one classically known eigenvector, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=1/(1+x)$
\end_inset

, which corresponds to the unit eigenvalue; this solution was given by Gauss.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kuzmin considers iterating this operator, and shows that given any continuous,
 differentiable function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

 with bounded derivative on the unit interval, that the iterate converges
 uniformly to 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=C/(1+x)$
\end_inset

.
 That is, by defining 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{k+1}(x)=\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}g_{k}\right](x)\]

\end_inset

 as the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th iterate of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{k}(x)\to C/(1+x)$
\end_inset

 uniformly, for all bounded, differentiable 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, as a corollary, this eigenvector is unique
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "section 15"
key "Khin35"

\end_inset

.
 An alternative way of understanding this result is via the Frobenius-Perron
 theorem, which asserts that the eigenfunction associated with the maximal
 eigenvalue is unique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from this one analytic solution, there is a large class of fractal,
 discontinuous-everywhere functions associated with eigenvalue 1.
 The prototypical such solution is the derivative of the Minkowski Question
 Mark function 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}?^{\prime}\right](x)=?^{\prime}(x)\]

\end_inset

A proper construction for the everywhere-discontinuous function 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, and the derivation of the above identity, is given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-mink2008"

\end_inset

, together with a construction of a class of other similar solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operator is not normal (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}\mathcal{L}_{h}^{T}$
\end_inset

 is not equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}^{T}\mathcal{L}_{h}$
\end_inset

); this is typically the case for transfer operators.
 Thus, the left and right eigenvectors are distinct, although they share
 common eigenvalues (technically, these should be called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

singular values
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, although we will persist in calling them eigenvalues below; and likewise
 diagonalization should properly be called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

singular value decomposition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the left and right eigenvectors are properly called the left and right
 singular vectors.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When considering a basis where the right-hand-side eigenvectors are smooth
 (differentiable), then the operator has a discrete spectrum (as is typically
 the case for transfer operators).
 The first eigenvalue below 1.0 is approximately 0.3036, and is known as the
 GKW constant [xxx need ref here].
 As is typically the case for transfer operators, when the right eigenvectors
 are smooth functions, then the left eigenvectors are linear combinations
 of derivatives of Dirac delta functions, located at 0 and 1.
 All of this is explored in greater detail, in the rest of this paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Relation to the Riemann Zeta Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gauss map is connected to the Riemann zeta function by a Mellin Transform:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=\frac{1}{s-1}-s\int_{0}^{1}h(x)\, x^{s-1}dx\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The Riemann zeta can be written under a change of variable as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-s\int_{0}^{1}dx\; x\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}x^{s-1}\right]\label{eq:zeta-gkw}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and thus it seems that a better understanding of GKW may shed light on the
 Riemann Hypothesis and/or the Berry conjecture.
 Most immediately, simple manipulations lead to a representation for the
 Riemann zeta in terms of binomial coefficients.
 This relation is explored in detail in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-zeta2004,Fla06"

\end_inset

; it leads to criteria that are shown to be equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis.
 The same development can be used to obtain Dirichlet L-functions, and generaliz
ations to other number-theoretic series, such as the totient series, or
 the Liouville series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Todo: Give the Riemann Hypothesis can be understood as a vector equation
 (using the polynomial form for the GKW, below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Lack of simple solutions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from the classical solution, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/(1+x)$
\end_inset

, there do not seem to be any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

easy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 polynomial series solutions to the operator, where a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

solution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be a closed-form specification of the eigenvectors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author performed a combinatorial search of simple combinations and summation
s of rational functions and various classical functions, such as the exponential
, the gamma, the digamma, the dilogarithm, Bessel functions and the exponential
 integral.
 No eigenvalues were found in this way, although, of course, various close
 approximations can be so obtained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The naivest approaches to solving the GKW operator, which is suggested by
 the eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:sum-form"

\end_inset

, is blocked by the next two theorems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
There is no (non-trivial) polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\tau)$
\end_inset

 such that the equation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(\frac{1}{\tau+n}\right)=\lambda_{n}\left(\tau+n\right)^{2}f\left(\tau\right)\]

\end_inset

 holds for all integer values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and arbitrary values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Assume that there does exist such a solution.
 Then it could be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(\tau\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}\tau^{k}\]

\end_inset

for some unknown values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 (which are independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).
 Inserting this into the hypothetical form leads to the equation 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\lambda_{n}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\tau^{k}\left[a_{k-2}+2na_{k-1}+n^{2}a_{k}\right] & =\\
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\tau^{k}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{k}}{n^{k}}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}a_{j}{j+k-1 \choose j-1}\frac{1}{n^{j}}\end{align*}

\end_inset

Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=1$
\end_inset

 in the above allows it to be re-written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda_{n}\left(n-1\right)^{2}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(-1\right)^{k}a_{k}=a_{0}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}n^{-k}\sum_{j=0}^{k}{k \choose j}\, a_{j+1}\]

\end_inset

Since the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 are independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 by assumption, one must then have 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, and for each term in the series on the right hand side, one must have,
 individually, that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\sum_{j=0}^{k}{k \choose j}\, a_{j+1}\]

\end_inset

or 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the theorem is proved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Were it not for this theorem, a solution would have been provided by looking
 for quasi-modular-form-like functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 Another naive avenue is also blocked: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
There is only one series solution to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(\frac{1}{\tau+n}\right)=\frac{\left(\tau+n\right)\left(\tau+1\right)}{\left(\tau+n+1\right)}\lambda f\left(\tau\right)\]

\end_inset

and it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\tau\right)=a_{0}/\left(1+\tau\right)$
\end_inset

 for any constant 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
As in the previous proof, assume a series solution.
 Substituting this into the above, and performing a straightforward but
 tedious expansion in powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, and then comparing terms, reveals that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}=\left(-1\right)^{k}a_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the above had allowed solutions for something other than 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, then one would have also had that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=\lambda f$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Assorted Algebraic Identities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section lists an assortment of random algebraic results, none particularly
 deep; some are vaguely suggestive of deeper relations.
 These are listed here mostly for the sake of completeness.
 These are the sorts of identities one obtains by means of knuckle-headed
 persistence in the hope that that maybe one little algebraic twist will
 yield a closed-form solution.
 These were obtained by the author long before he knew that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}$
\end_inset

 had a name or had been previously studied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we notice that adjacent terms in the series can be made to cancel
 by shifting the series by one:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}f\right](x)-\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}f\right](x+1)=\frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}}f\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

which holds for any function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x).$
\end_inset

 Thus, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset

 is an eigenvector, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}\rho=\lambda\rho$
\end_inset

, then it would also solve 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}}\rho\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right)=\lambda\left(\rho(x)-\rho(x+1)\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This can be solved easily to get the zeroth eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\rho_{0}(x)=\frac{1}{\ln2}\;\frac{1}{1+x}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

which satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $[\mathcal{L}_{h}\rho_{0}](x)=\rho_{0}(x)$
\end_inset

 and the normalization is given by requiring 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{1}\rho_{0}(x)\, dx=1\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can see one hint of the relationship between period-doubling and the
 GKW in the identity 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{1}{1+x}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{2^{n}}\left[\frac{2}{x+n}-\frac{1}{x+n+1}\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A reflection identity: 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=1-(1+x)^{-2}$
\end_inset

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=1-f$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}[(1+?(x))/(1+x)^{2}]=1-?(x)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset

 is the Minkowski Question Mark function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}[?(x)\, x^{-2}]=2-?(x)$
\end_inset

 .
 One can construct a variety of identities of this sort, for example: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{h}\left[?(x)\left(\frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}}-2\right)\right]=\frac{?(x)-2}{(1+x)^{2}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

but these types of exercises do not seem to lead to any sort of worthwhile
 recurrence relations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acting on the monomial, one gets 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}x^{k}\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{(n+x)^{k+2}}=\frac{(-)^{k+2}}{(k+1)!}\psi^{(k+1)}(1+x)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{(k)}(x)$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th derivative of the Gamma function.
 The true difficulty of finding the solution to GKW becomes clear when the
 search leads one to start discovering complicated identities, such as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{m^{2}}\psi^{(1)}\left(1+\frac{1}{m}+x\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{(n+x)^{2}}\psi^{(1)}\left(\frac{1}{n+x}+1\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

or to finding curiosities such as 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=(1+ax)^{2}$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=\psi^{(1)}(1+x+a)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=(1+nx)^{-2}-1$
\end_inset

 one gets 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=-\sum_{k=1}^{n}(x+k)^{-2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acting on a general power, the map gives the Hurwitz Zeta: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}x^{s}\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{(n+x)^{s+2}}=\zeta_{H}(s+2,x+1)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This allows eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:zeta-gkw"

\end_inset

 to be written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-s\int_{0}^{1}dx\; x\zeta_{H}\left(s+1,x+1\right)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further consideration leads to various conditionally convergent series:
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}\,\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)\zeta(k+m+2)=1\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

which holds for any integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 Additional series, similar to the form given above, are possible, and are
 reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-A&S-Anno"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, for example, one has:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}\,\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m+1\end{array}\right)\zeta(k+m+2)=\zeta(m+2)-1\]

\end_inset

 We also have series such as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\lim_{t\rightarrow0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}e^{-tk}=\frac{1}{2}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\lim_{t\rightarrow0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}(k+2)e^{-tk}=\frac{3}{4}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\lim_{t\rightarrow0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}(k+2)(k+3)e^{-tk}=\frac{7}{4}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\lim_{t\rightarrow0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}(k+2)(k+3)(k+4)e^{-tk}=\frac{45}{8}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\lim_{t\rightarrow0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}(k+2)(k+3)(k+4)(k+5)e^{-tk}=\frac{93}{4}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Its not clear what the general expression for forms of the above type is.
 Similarly, if we let 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S_{m}\equiv\lim_{t\rightarrow0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}\frac{(k+m+1)!}{(k+1)!}\left[\zeta(k+m+2)-1\right]e^{-tk}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

then we find 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}=1/2$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}=1/4$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{2}=1/4$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{3}=3/8$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{4}=3/4$
\end_inset

 but its again not clear what the general expression might be.
 The above sums are generated by considering 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\psi(1+z)=\frac{-1}{1+z}+1-\gamma+\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}(-)^{m}\left[\zeta(m+2)-1\right]z^{m+1}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and then writing 
\begin_inset Formula \[
z^{m+1}=(z+1-1)^{m+1}=\sum_{k=0}^{m}(-)^{m-k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
m\\
k\end{array}\right)(z+1)^{k}\]

\end_inset

The generating function for the moments of the Minkowski Question Mark
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This generating function obeys the relation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{z^{2}}G\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)+\frac{1}{\left(z+1\right)^{2}}G\left(\frac{1}{z+1}\right)=\frac{1}{z\left(z+1\right)}\]

\end_inset

which holds for complex-valued 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 (such as, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $z\mapsto z+n$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{z}+\frac{1}{z^{2}}G\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)=G\left(z\right)-2G\left(z+1\right)\]

From this, one has the curious shift-over-by-one relationship 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}G\right]\left(z\right)=G\left(1+z\right)+\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}K\right]\left(z\right)\]

\begin_layout Subsection
Polynomial Representation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can attempt to solve GKW by working in the polynomial representation.
 One possible choice is to make one's Taylor expansion about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

, but this turns out to be a very poor choice, as we shall soon see.
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=g$
\end_inset

 and substituting a Taylor's expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, so that
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{k}}{k!}f^{(k)}(0)\]

\end_inset

and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

, one gets 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{g^{(m)}(0)}{m!}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\,(-)^{m}\;\frac{(k+m+1)!}{m!\,(k+1)!}\,\zeta(k+m+2)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

or, adopting the bra-ket notation introduced earlier
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ve-B04"

\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left\langle m\left|\mathcal{L}_{h}\right|k\right\rangle =(-)^{m}\;\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\zeta(k+m+2)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where we've replaced the factorials by the binomial coefficient that they
 form.
 Unfortunately, this is clearly a very poorly conditioned matrix.
 One can make some progress, if one wishes, by applying a regulator and
 using Levin-type sequence acceleration techniques.
 One can thus find a number of curious identities, some of which we've listed
 previously.
 However, the difficulty of working with divergent sums seems to outweigh
 any advantages given by the relatively simple form of the matrix elements.
 Thus, one is lead to consider the matrix elements for a polynomial expansion
 about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

.
 These are far more complex, but give a very well-conditioned matrix.
 These are: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
G_{mn}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\left[\zeta(k+m+2)-1\right]\label{eq:GKW-matrix-elts}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
(-)^{m}\frac{g^{(m)}(1)}{m!}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}G_{mn}(-)^{n}\frac{f^{(n)}(1)}{n!}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Other authors have chosen to expand about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Briggs2003"

\end_inset

 but it would appear that expansion about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

 leads to the simplest tractable expansion.
 The general case, of a Taylor's expansion about some fixed point, is explored
 in the appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first eigenvalue is known as the GKW constant, and is about 0.3036.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eigenvector equation to be solved is then 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}G_{mn}v_{n}=\lambda v_{m}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\{v_{n}\}$
\end_inset

 is an eigenvector with components 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 This beast has a discrete spectrum (need reference for proof), and so we
 may label the eigenvalues and eigenvectors with a label 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, so that the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th eigen equation is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}G_{mn}v_{nk}=\lambda_{k}v_{mk}\label{eq:Eigenvalue eqn}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th polynomial eigenfunction of the GKW operator is then given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\rho_{k}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}v_{nk}(1-x)^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The zeroth eigenfunction was given by Gauss as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\rho_{0}(x)=\frac{1}{1+x}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and corresponds to the eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n0}=2^{-n}$
\end_inset

.
 Again, we note the curious appearance of powers of two.
 Graphs of the first few eigenvectors are shown in figure

This graph shows the right eigenfunctions of the GKW operator.
 These were computed numerically, by truncating the GKW operator to a submatrix
 of 55 by 55 elements and then solving for the eigenvectors of the matrix.
 The elements of the eigenvectors appear to be well-behaved, being oscillatory
 for small values, and then converging to zero rapidly.

\begin_layout Standard
Based on numerical explorations (reported below), the series appears to
 be easily convergent even for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

.
 In particular, it appears that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty}v_{nk}=0$
\end_inset

, and that furthermore, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty}v_{nk}/v_{n+1,k}=2$
\end_inset

.
 One must not conclude that this implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{nk}~\mathcal{O}(2^{-n})$
\end_inset

, as this sort of asymptotic behaviour conflicts with the zeroth eigenfunction.
 Thus, one might guess at 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{nk}~\mathcal{O}(n^{s}2^{-n})$
\end_inset

 but numeric data suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

.
 Numeric data also excludes the form 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{nk}~\mathcal{O}(2^{-n}\log n)$
\end_inset

 although it is possible that the softer 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{nk}~\mathcal{O}(2^{-n}\log\log n)$
\end_inset

 might hold.

\begin_layout Standard
The coefficients are oscillatory, with 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 half-oscillations in the

'th eigenvector.
 That is, for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=0$
\end_inset

, all of the 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n0}$
\end_inset

 can be taken to be of the same sign.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n1}$
\end_inset

 change sign, once, between 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

, the coefficients change sign twice, and so on.
 This is shown in the graph

'th derivative of the Dirac delta function.

\end_inset

.
 Very curiously, this is the harmonic series.
 Thus, true to form, it appears that yet again, we are in the presence of
 another manifestation of the duality between the dyadic rationals and rationals
, the duality between the Stern-Brocot tree and the dyadic tree, the duality
 captured in the Minkowski Question Mark function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In analogy to the right eigenvectors, the series again appears to be not
 only convergent in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty}w_{kn}=0$
\end_inset

, but also that a strict ratio is maintained in the limit: 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty}(n+2)\, w_{kn}/(n+1)\, w_{k,n+1}=1$
\end_inset

, with strict equality holding for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, and not just in the limit, when 
\begin_inset Formula $k=0$
\end_inset

.
 A similar oscillatory behaviour is seen as well, as shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Left-Eigenvector-Coefficients"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Identity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have the identity
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}G_{mn}p^{-n}=p\left[\zeta(m+1)-1-\zeta_{H}\left(m+1,2+\frac{1}{p-1}\right)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

In particular, for 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2$
\end_inset

, the right hand side equals 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{-m}$
\end_inset

; this corresponds to the known eigenvector.
 Note that for any value of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, the leading term on the right is 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-(m+1)}$
\end_inset

.
 A simple way to arrive at this is to note that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}p^{-n}(1-x)^{n}=\frac{p}{p-1+x}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and then evaluate this simple expression under the action of the GKW operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Kernel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would like to know what the kernel of the GKW operator is.
 Consider 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
k(x)=\frac{1}{x^{2}}\exp(2k+1)\frac{\pi}{x}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Then 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}k\right](x) & = & \exp\left((2k+1)\pi x\right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\cos(2k+1)n\pi\nonumber \\
 & = & \exp\left((2k+1)\pi x\right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-)^{n}\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The value of the sum is ambiguous.
 One is tempted to cancel terms pairwise, and thus declare 
\begin_inset Formula $k(x)$
\end_inset

 to belong to the kernel.
 On the other hand, the regularized sum is not zero: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\lim_{t\rightarrow0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}e^{-tk}=\frac{1}{2}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and so one is left in a bit of a quandary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some progress might be made by applying the theory of the Henstock-Kurzweil
 integral.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Numeric Attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can mount numeric attacks on the GKW operator.
 The matrix elements in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:GKW-matrix-elts"

\end_inset

 are easily computed numerically, and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are
 easily obtained by applying standard matrix diagonalization software.
 For example, using the LAPACK DGEEV eigenvalue-finding routine, and working
 with the upper-left 
\begin_inset Formula $55\times55$
\end_inset

 entry block of the GKW operator, one obtains the eigenvalues shown in table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:GKW-Eigenvalues"

\end_inset

 These may be numerically compared to previously published values (need
 reference for previous numerics).

This table lists the first dozen eigenvalues of the polynomial representation
 of the GKW operator.
 The numbers are certain to about about the last figure or two quoted.
 They were obtained by numerically inverting the 55 by 55 entry upper-right

\begin_layout Standard
Eigenvectors can be guessed at in various ways.
 One can find, for instance, that the first right-hand-side eigenvector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}$
\end_inset

 is approximated by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\rho_{1}(x)\approx\frac{-3}{4}+\frac{7}{4}\frac{1}{(1+x)^{5/2}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

with the approximation accurate to about one or two percent over the domain
 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 This is the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}\approx0.303663$
\end_inset

.
 Numerics suggest that all of the eigenvectors have a pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=-1$
\end_inset

.
 Whether they might have poles at other negative values is unclear; however,
 the idea that the eigenvectors might be linear combinations of the Hurwitz
 zeta function suggests itself.
 Thus, for example, a slightly better approximation is given by: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\rho_{1}(x)\approx3.078\left[\zeta_{H}(2,1+x)-\frac{1.32}{(1+x)^{3/4}}\right]\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{H}$
\end_inset

 is the Hurwitz zeta function: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta_{H}(s,q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(n+q)^{-s}\]

\end_inset

 Graphs of the first seven right-hand-side eigenvectors are shown in figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The general oscillatory nature of the eigenfunctions is echoed in the numeric
 values of the eigenvector coefficients themselves, shown in figures

This figure shows the 100 by 100 submatrix of the entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}$
\end_inset

, with row,column (0,0) in the upper left.
 Each square pixel represents one entry in the matrix; this this picture
 is 100 by 100 pixels in size.
 Black areas represent negative values of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}$
\end_inset

 while colored areas are postive.
 The coloration is such that red corresponds to large values, moving through
 the rainbow to smaller values.
 The color scale is logarithmic, so red-orange represents values of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}\sim10^{-3}$
\end_inset

, yellow-green to 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}\sim10^{-20}$
\end_inset

 and blue to 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}\sim10^{-40}$
\end_inset

.
 Visually, the hyperbolic curves suggest that 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}$
\end_inset

 is approximately constant when the product of the indexes 
\begin_inset Formula $mn$
\end_inset

 is held constant.
 However, the curves are not true hyperboplas; a closer numerical examination
 shows that a better fit is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(m+n\right)^{1.7}-\left|m-n\right|^{1.7}\approx const$
\end_inset

.

\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}$

 is approximately constant when the product of the indexes

 A closer numerical look shows that the curves are not quite hyperbolas,
 but are roughly approximated by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(m+n\right)^{1.7}-\left|m-n\right|^{1.7}\approx const\]

\end_inset

Furthermore, the limiting behaviour for 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ll n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ll m$
\end_inset

 doesn't seem to be hyperbolic either, as can seen in a pixel-aliasing/Moire
 type effect visible in the graph, at about 
\begin_inset Formula $m\approx5n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n\approx4m$
\end_inset

.
 In particular, some of the contours appear to merge along the line 
\begin_inset Formula $n\approx4m$
\end_inset

.
 As will be shown in a later section, where the asymptotic expansion of
 the matrix elements is considered, this corresponds to the non-trivial
 zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the critical strip.

Shown are the matrix elements

 of the GKW operator along the diagonal.
 As these are exponentially vanishing, the figure rescales these: thus,
 the red line shows the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{nn}2^{-n-1}\sqrt{\pi n}$
\end_inset

.
 The matrix elements are also oscillatory: the overall structure is easily
 accounted for, as shown by the green line, which graphs 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin\left(\pi n/2+\pi/4\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The period, phase and amplitude of the oscillations appears to be exact:
 a numerical exploration out to

\end_inset

 indicates that this oscillation hold very precisely.

\begin_layout Subsection
Asymptotic Expansion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The asymptotic behaviour of the matrix elements for large 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n$
\end_inset

 can be obtained by converting the Newton series 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:GKW-matrix-elts"

\end_inset

 to N√∂rlund‚ÄìRice integral, and then using saddle-point methods to obtain
 the large 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n$
\end_inset

 behaviour.
 A detailed exposition of this proceedure is given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Fla06"

\end_inset

; what follows is an abbreviated applicatin of those techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several key steps to this process.
 The first is the observation that a Newton series can be re-written as
 a N√∂rlund‚ÄìRice integral: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=n_{0}}^{n}\left(-1\right)^{k}{n \choose k}\phi\left(k\right)=\frac{\left(-1\right)^{n}}{2\pi i}\oint_{c}\phi\left(s\right)\frac{n!}{s\left(s-1\right)\cdots\left(s-n\right)}ds\]

\end_inset

 where the contour 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 surrounds the poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ n_{0},\cdots,n\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 is holomorphic in the region 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>n_{0}-\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Substitution of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:GKW-matrix-elts"

\end_inset

 into the above yeilds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
G_{mn}=\frac{\left(-1\right)^{n}}{2\pi i}\frac{n!}{m!}\oint_{C}\frac{\left(s+m+1\right)\left(s+m\right)\cdots\left(s+2\right)}{s\left(s-1\right)\cdots\left(s-n\right)}\left[\zeta\left(s+m+2\right)-1\right]ds\label{eq:gkw-integrand}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Written in this form, the zeros and poles of the integrand are clearly
 evident.
 It also becomes clear that the right-hand closure of the contour integral
 contributes nothing, since, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s\to\infty$
\end_inset

, one has that the integrand decays exponentially, 
\emph on
viz
\emph default
.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta\left(s+m+2\right)-1\to2^{-s}+\mathcal{O}\left(3^{-s}\right)$
\end_inset

 which over-powers the polynomial numerator and drives the integrand to
 zero.
 Thus, the closed contour can be replaced by a line integral running from
 
\begin_inset Formula $c-i\infty$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $c+i\infty$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re c$
\end_inset

 to the left of the poles:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
G_{mn}=\frac{\left(-1\right)^{n+1}}{2\pi i}\frac{\Gamma\left(n+1\right)}{\Gamma\left(m+1\right)}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\frac{\Gamma\left(s+m+2\right)\Gamma\left(s-n\right)}{\Gamma\left(s+2\right)\Gamma\left(s+1\right)}\left[\zeta\left(s+m+2\right)-1\right]ds\]

\end_inset

The integrand becomes exponentially large for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s\to-\infty$
\end_inset

 and this leads to a pair of saddle points above and below the real axis:
 each saddle is situated between the exponential rise to the left and the
 poles, and straddles a hump between the zeros and the exponentially decay
 to the right.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $m=n$
\end_inset

, it will be shown that the saddle points occur at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\pm in+\mathcal{O}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The integrand and its saddle points is illustrated in the figure

 The real axis runs along the middle of the figure.
 Blue and black areas represent small or zero values of the modulus, while
 yellow and red represent large values.
 Thus, the exponential decay to the right is shown in blue-black, while
 the exponential rise to the left is red.
 Arrayed along the real axis are eleven poles, at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0,\cdots,10$
\end_inset

 and ten zeros, at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=-2,\cdots,-11$

\begin_layout Standard
The integral may be estimated for 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n\to\infty$
\end_inset

 by applying the method of steepest descent.
 That is, one deforms the integration contour so that it passes through
 the saddle-point, following the steepest path through it.
 There, on applies Laplaces method to approximate the integral as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\int e^{Nf\left(x\right)}dx=e^{Nf\left(x_{0}\right)}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{-Nf^{\prime\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)}}\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)\right)\label{eq:steepest descent}\end{equation}

\end_inset

with the integration contour running through the saddle point 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 To be able to apply this, the logarithm of the integrand, expanded in powers
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, is required.
 As mentioned, the saddle points will be discovered at 
\begin_inset Formula $s\approx\pm in$
\end_inset

, thus suggesting the change of variable 
\begin_inset Formula $s=nx$
\end_inset

 and an expansion in powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $N=n$
\end_inset

, while holding 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 fixed.
 To avoid a concurrent expansion in powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, write 
\begin_inset Formula $m=Kn$
\end_inset

 for some fixed constant 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 One may then proceed with the expansion.
 The zeta function terms expands as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\log\left[\zeta\left(s+m+2\right)-1\right]=-\left[n\left(x+K\right)+2\right]\log2+\mathcal{O}\left(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n\left(x+K\right)}\right)\]

\end_inset

The gamma functions are expanded by applying Stirling's formula, in leading
 powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\log\Gamma\left(ny\right)=ny\log\left(ny\right)-ny-\frac{1}{2}\log\left(ny\right)+\frac{1}{2}\log\left(2\pi\right)+\frac{1}{12ny}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n^{3}}\right)\]

\end_inset

which is applicable for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re y>0$
\end_inset

.
 This can be applied in a straightforward way, although one must first write
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma\left(s-n\right)=\frac{\pi\left(-1\right)^{n}}{\sin\left(\pi s\right)\Gamma\left(n-s+1\right)}\]

\end_inset

which follows from the reflection formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma\left(z\right)\Gamma\left(1-z\right)=\pi/\sin\pi z$
\end_inset

.
 For the saddle point in the upper half-plane, tht is, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Im x>0$
\end_inset

, one expands 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\log\sin\pi xn= & \log\left(\frac{-e^{-i\pi nx}}{2i}+\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-\pi n\Im x}\right)\right)\\
= & -i\pi nx+\frac{i\pi}{2}-\log2+\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-2\pi n\Im x}\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

Combining all of these elements, one then obtains the following asymptotic
 expansion in 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
Nf\left(x\right)= & n\left(K-1\right)\log n\\
 & +n\left[i\pi x-\left(x+K\right)\log2-2x\log x-\left(1-x\right)\log\left(1-x\right)+\left(K+x\right)\log\left(K+x\right)+1-K\right]\\
 & -\log n\\
 & -2\log x-\frac{1}{2}\log\left(1-x\right)+\frac{3}{2}\log\left(K+x\right)-\log8\pi\\
 & +\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

The first derivative is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
Nf^{\prime}\left(x\right)= & n\left[i\pi-\log2+\log\frac{\left(1-x\right)\left(K+x\right)}{x^{2}}\right]\\
 & +\frac{1}{2\left(1-x\right)}+\frac{3}{2\left(K+x\right)}-\frac{2}{x}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
Nf^{\prime\prime}\left(x\right)= & n\left[\frac{1}{K+x}-\frac{1}{1-x}-\frac{2}{x}\right]\\
 & +\frac{2}{x^{2}}+\frac{1}{2\left(1-x\right)^{2}}-\frac{3}{2\left(K+x\right)^{2}}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

Solving for the saddle points 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x_{0}=\frac{K-1}{2}\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1-6K+K^{2}}+\frac{1}{n}\left(\frac{7Kx_{0}-3x_{0}-6K}{2\left(K-x_{0}^{2}\right)}\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right)\label{eq:saddle pt}\end{equation}

\end_inset

For the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $m=n$
\end_inset

, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $K=1$
\end_inset

, one gets the simple form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{0,m=n}=\pm i+\frac{1}{n}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\pm i\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right)\]

\end_inset

To obtain asymptotic expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}$
\end_inset

, it is now enough to insert the saddle point 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:saddle pt"

\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:steepest descent"

\end_inset

.
 The algebra is considerably simplified by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $K=1$
\end_inset

.
 The final result is precisely that already discovered numerically: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
G_{nn}=\frac{1}{2^{n+1}\sqrt{\pi n}}\sin\frac{\pi}{2}\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\left[1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset

This is an exact, analytic result for the asymptotic expansion of the GKW
 matrix elements as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset

, obtained by using the method of steepest descent applied to the N√∂rlund‚ÄìRice
 integral of the Newton series of the GKW operator matrix elements

The Frobenius-Perron operator for this function is exactly solvable, and
 provides a toy model of the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator.
 The Frobenius-Perron operator of this sawtooth, acting on a general function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

, is given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{w}f\right](x)=\sum_{x':w(x')=x}\frac{f(x')}{\left|dw(x')/dx'\right|}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}f\left(\frac{n+1-x}{n(n+1)}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

We develop a representation of this operator in the monomial-basis Hilbert
 space below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Polynomial Eigenfunctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will want to consider the action of this operator on polynomials of 
\begin_inset Formula $y=1-x$
\end_inset

, so that we can express 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 as a Taylor's expansion about 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset

.
 Lets make this change-of-variable now, and write 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
f(y)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}y^{k}\equiv\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}y^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{w}f\right](y)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}b_{k}y^{k}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}\left(\frac{n+y}{n(n+1)}\right)^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Rearranging the sums, and equating terms with the same power of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, we define the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{mk}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
b_{m}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}W_{mk}a_{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and find that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
W_{mk}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
m\end{array}\right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-m-1}(n+1)^{-k-1} & \;\textrm{ for \;} & k\geq m\\
0 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & k<m\end{array}\right.\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where we use 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
m\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset

 to denote the binomial coefficient.
 This matrix is upper-triangular, and thus has its eigenvalues along the
 diagonal.
 These are 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\lambda_{k}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{k+1}(n+1)^{k+1}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=2\zeta(2)-3$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(x)$
\end_inset

 is the Riemann zeta.
 Numerically, we can see that the first few eigenvalues are 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=0.289868...$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=0.130396...$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{3}=0.0633278...$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{4}=0.031383...$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{5}=0.0156468...$
\end_inset

 We can trivially see that the ratio of eigenvalues settles down to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{k}/\lambda_{k+1}=2$
\end_inset

 for large 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, since the first term of the sum will dominate for large 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can solve the operator through recursion on the matrix elements of a
 related operator, by observing that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
Z_{mk}\equiv\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{m}(n+1)^{k}}\left[\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}\right]=Z_{m,k-1}-Z_{m-1,k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

These recurrence relations are bounded on the edges by 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{00}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{01}=2-\zeta(2)$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
Z_{0k} &  & =Z_{0,k-1}-\left(\zeta(k+1)-1\right)=1-\sum_{j=1}^{k}\left[\zeta(j+1)-1\right]\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{10}=\zeta(2)-1$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
Z_{m0}=\zeta(m+1)-Z_{m-1,0}=(-)^{m}\left[1+\sum_{j=1}^{m}(-)^{j}\zeta(j+1)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and we have 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{mk}=W_{mk}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $m\leq k$
\end_inset

 .
 The first few eigenfunctions are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e_{0}(y)=1\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e_{1}(y)=1-2y\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
e_{2}(y) & = & \frac{15-13\zeta(2)-9\zeta(3)+2\zeta(2)[\zeta(2)+3\zeta(3)]}{3(13\zeta(2)-8\zeta(3))(3-2\zeta(2))}+\nonumber \\
 &  & +\frac{6\zeta(2)+2\zeta(3)-12}{13-8\zeta(2)}\, y+y^{2}\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

We see that although the eigenfunctions are polynomials and are exactly
 solvable, they quickly spiral out of control.

\begin_layout Section
Singular Sawtooth of the Second Kind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The singular sawtooth of the second kind is given by the dyadic-space conjugate
 of the continued-fraction shift function 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
c(x)=?\left(\frac{1}{?^{-1}(x)}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{?^{-1}(x)}\right\rfloor \right)=(?\circ h\circ?^{-1})(x)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset

 is the Minkowski Question Mark, presented in earlier chapters.
 This map consists of straight-line segments between values of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2^{k}$
\end_inset

, as pictured in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:Singular-Sawtooth,-Second"

\end_inset

, and can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
c(x)=2-2^{n}x\;\textrm{ for \; }\frac{1}{2^{n}}<x\leq\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Just as the Gauss Map is able to lop off the leading term of the continued
 fraction expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, so this map is able to lop off all of the leading zeros of the binary
 expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The downward slope of the sawtooth just reflects the binary expansion,
 exchanging 1's for 0's, so that the next iteration can chop of the next
 contiguous chunk.
 Thus, the orbits of points under this map are completely isomorphic to
 the orbits of points under the Gauss Map.
 This is indeed the very idea of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Frobenius-Perron operator of this function provides a second model of
 the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator.
 It can be solved exactly; unfortunately, while one might think that there
 is a similarity transform to take it back to GKW, it turns out this similarity
 transform is dastardly singular, being just the Jacobian of the Minkowski
 Question Mark 
\begin_inset Formula $(?'\circ?^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset

, which we examine in detail in a related paper of this series.
 Thus, although the point dynamics of this sawtooth map are completely isomorphi
c to the point dynamics of the Gauss Map, the spectra of the associated
 transfer operators are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 identical.
 This is perhaps the most surprising result of this paper.
 The transfer operator is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{C}f\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n}}f\left(\frac{2-x}{2^{n}}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

As before, we change variables to 
\begin_inset Formula $y=1-x$
\end_inset

, expand both sides in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, and match terms to find the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
C_{mk}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
m\end{array}\right)\frac{1}{2^{k+1}-1}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 which is upper triangular (we take the binomial coefficients to be vanishing
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $k<m$
\end_inset

).
 The eigenvalues lie along the diagonal.
 The first few are 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=1/3$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=1/7$
\end_inset

 with the ratio of successive eigenvalues tending to 2.
 The first few eigenvectors are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e_{0}=1\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e_{1}=1-2y=2x-1\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}

 & = & \frac{-1}{29\cdot193}\left(193+1350x+2940x^{2}+3360x^{3}-13440x^{4}\right)\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

As we can see, the complexity of individual eigenvectors spirals out of
 control; there's no obvious simple closed form expression for higher eigenvecto
rs.
 Indeed, it seems that the simplest algorithm is to directly invert the
 matrix.
 This is curious, because the matrix itself is so curiously simple, and
 superficially similar to that for the Bernoulli map.

\begin_layout Subsection
The Failure of the Similarity Transform for the Polynomial Basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under normal circumstances, whenever one has a pair of maps 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x)$
\end_inset

 that are conjugate to each other through an invertible function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(x)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)=(\phi\circ\beta\circ\phi^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset

, then there exists a similarity transform 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}$
\end_inset

 such that the Frobenius-Perron operators are also conjugate; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}=S_{\phi}\mathcal{L}_{\beta}S_{\phi}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}^{-1}=S_{\phi^{-1}}$
\end_inset

.
 Formally, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}=1/(\phi'\circ\phi^{-1})$
\end_inset

 where the prime denotes differentiation: 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi'(x)=d\phi(x)/dx$
\end_inset

 .
 Since the continued-fraction shift function is conjugate to the sawtooth,
 one might hope that GKW would be conjugate to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{C}$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}=S_{?}\mathcal{L}_{C}S_{?}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, the Minkowski Question Mark is highly singular and is not
 traditionally differentiable, and so we cannot build such a similarity
 transform using the polynomial function basis.
 Another way to deduce this is to note that the similarity transform 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}$
\end_inset

, working as a traditional, ordinary operator, normally preserves the eigenvalue
s; that is, the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 equal those of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 In the current case, we see trouble in that the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{C}$
\end_inset

 are not those of GKW.
 They are not even 'close', in that the ratio of tends to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{k}/\lambda_{k+1}=2$
\end_inset

 whereas for the GKW the ratio is 2.61803...

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are suggestive elements.
 For example, the function argument 
\begin_inset Formula $(2-x)/2^{n}$
\end_inset

 is just the dyadic polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $(g_{D}^{n-1}r_{D}g_{D})(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Tantalizingly, the corresponding Moebius transform is 
\begin_inset Formula $(g_{C}^{n-1}r_{C}g_{C})(x)=1/(n+x)$
\end_inset

 which is the function argument to the GKW operator.
 This suggests the tantalizing re-write of the terms of GKW as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
f\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)=f\circ?^{-1}\left(\frac{2-?(x)}{2^{n}}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Also, one can do strange things such as xxx but why do we want to do that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point is to not give up hope on the operator relationships, even though
 the polynomial basis breaks the relationship.
 Thus, we are motivated to explore other bases, and not just the polynomial
 basis.
 Fortunately, we can find some of these.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fractal Eigenfunctions of the Second Sawtooth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Takagi curve can be used to build an alternate set of eigenfunctions
 for the second sawtooth, possessing continuous-spectrum eigenvalues.
 These eigenfunctions are not differentiable, and thus cannot be obtained
 through polynomials, and thus are not visible when working with the operator
 in a polynomial-basis Hilbert Space.
 They can be used to build an alternate function space, in which the Second
 Sawtooth remains exactly solvable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We recognize from the studying of the dyadic representation of the Modular
 Group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

 that the second sawtooth is expressed in terms of the group element 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[g_{D}^{k-1}r_{D}g_{D}\right](x)=\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}-\frac{x}{2^{k}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{C}f\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n}}f\left(\left[g_{D}^{n-1}r_{D}g_{D}\right](x)\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and thus functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 possessing the modular group symmetry are candidates for solving the operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{C}$
\end_inset

.
 The candidates we have in mind are of course the family of Takagi Curves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin by defining the Takagi Curve as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
t_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\tau\left(2^{k}x-\left\lfloor 2^{k}x\right\rfloor \right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)$
\end_inset

 is the triangle wave: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tau(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
2x & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 0\leq x\leq1/2\\
2(1-x) & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This form of the Takagi curve transforms under the three-dimensional representat
ion of the Modular Group.
 Specifically, we write 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g_{3}^{n}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1/2^{n} & 0\\
0 & q_{n}(w) & w\end{array}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}(w)$
\end_inset

 is the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
q_{n}(w)=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\sum_{k-0}^{n-1}(2w)^{k}=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\left(\frac{1-(2w)^{n}}{1-2w}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

We write out the full matrix form for 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{3}^{k-1}r_{3}g_{3}$
\end_inset

 and apply the group action isomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}g_{D}^{k-1}r_{D}g_{D}=g_{3}^{k-1}r_{3}g_{3}t_{w}$
\end_inset

 to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
t_{w}\left(\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}-\frac{x}{2^{k}}\right)=q_{k-1}(w)+x\left(w^{k-1}-q_{k-1}(w)/2\right)+w^{k}t_{w}(x)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Inserting the above back into the definition for the sawtooth operator,
 and performing the sum, we get
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{C}t_{w}\right](x)=\frac{4}{3(2-w)}+\frac{x}{3(2-w)}+\frac{wt_{w}(x)}{2-w}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

From this, we can immediately read off the eigenvalue as 
\begin_inset Formula $w/(2-w)$
\end_inset

.
 To get the eigenfunction, we need to complete the diagonalization by using
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{C}1\right](x)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{C}x\right](x)=(2-x)/3$
\end_inset

 to get the eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
E_{2}(x)=\frac{2-w}{2(w+1)(w-1)}+\frac{x}{2(w+1)}+t_{w}(x)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

It should be clear from this presentation that the higher and lower dimensional
 Takagi curves, of both even and odd parity, give eigenvectors and eigenvalues
 as well.
 We present a few more here:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previously, we saw that the Takagi Curves served as basis vectors for a
 space of degenerate eigenfunctions of the Bernoulli Map, associated with
 arbitrary eigenvalue.
 We saw that this space could also be spanned by the Hurwitz Zeta, through
 a change of basis.
 Thus, we expect that we can extend these results to this map as well.

and thus that the spectrum of its Frobenius-Perron Operator is identical
 to that of the Bernoulli Map, and that this map can be trivially brushed
 aside as belonging to that conjugacy class.
 Nothing could be farther from the truth.
 In fact, it is conjugate, but the conjugating function is the Minkowski
 Question Mark: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F(x)=(?^{-1}\circ\tau\circ?)(x)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and so the relationship is anything but trivial.
 The easiest way to see this is to note that we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 are combinations of the modular group element 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
g_{C}^{-1}(x)\;\textrm{ if }\;0\leq x\leq1/2\\
(g_{C}^{-1}\circ r)(x)\;\textrm{ if }\;1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

following the notation of earlier chapters, and
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tau(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
g_{D}^{-1}(x)\;\textrm{ if }\;0\leq x\leq1/2\\
(g_{D}^{-1}\circ r)(x)\;\textrm{ if }\;1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Just as we saw with the second sawtooth, the point dynamics of the Isola
 Map and the Tent Map are isomorphic to each other, but the eigenvalue spectra
 are inequivalent.
 The Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator for the Isola Map is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{P}f\right](x)=\frac{1}{\left(1+x\right)^{2}}\left[f\left(\frac{x}{x+1}\right)+f\left(\frac{1}{x+1}\right)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Isola shows how the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator can be constructed through
 some simple operator relationships on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 and so it is a worthwhile goal to attempt to solve 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

.
 As we will see below, this seems to be an even harder task.

Closely related is a modular variant of the Bernoulli shift, given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
A\left(y\right)=?^{-1}\left(\mbox{frac}\left(2?\left(y\right)\right)\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{y}{1-y} & \mbox{ for }0\le y\le\frac{1}{2}\\
\frac{2y-1}{y} & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le y\le1\end{cases}\label{eq:defn-A}\end{equation}

The associated transfer operator is 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_layout Subsection
The (Lack of a) Polynomial Basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on our previous luck, we attempt to define the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 in the polynomial basis.
 First, we attempt an expansion at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

.
 This leads to 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{P}_{nk} & \equiv & \left\langle n\left|\mathcal{P}\right|k\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & = & (-)^{n}\left[\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+n+1\\
k+1\end{array}\right)+\Theta_{k\leq n}(-)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n+1\\
k+1\end{array}\right)\right]\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

This matrix is not triangular, and is thus not directly solvable.
 It is also very ill-conditioned, making it not numerically tractable, at
 least, not in any simple fashion.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 gets large, the matrix elements grow exponentially on the diagonal.
 This is easily seen by applying Stirling's asymptotic formula for the factorial
 to the binomial; one easily gets 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\approx\frac{2^{n+1}}{\sqrt{2\pi n}}\exp\left(\frac{-(2k-n)^{2}}{2n}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

when 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 get large.
 Thus, along the diagonal, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{nn}\approx4^{n+1}/2\sqrt{\pi n}$
\end_inset

, and the matrix is not tractable numerically, and would be painful to work
 with analytically, without defining some sort of regulator.
 Thus, we are motivated to look at the expansion at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

.
 Here, however, the situation is not much better.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula $y=x-1/2$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{Q}f\right](x)=\frac{1}{\left(y+3/2\right)^{2}}\left[f\left(\frac{y+1/2}{y+3/2}\right)+f\left(\frac{1}{y+3/2}\right)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

we work through the same set of steps to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{Q}_{nk} & \equiv & \left\langle n\left|\mathcal{Q}\right|k\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & = & \left(\frac{-2}{3}\right)^{n+2}\left[\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+n+1\\
k+1\end{array}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{k}\;\sum_{p=0}^{\min(n,k)}\left(-3\right)^{p}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n+k-p+1\\
k+1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
p\end{array}\right)\right]\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

which is far more complex, and only marginally less divergent: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{Q}_{nn}\sim(16/9)^{n+1}$
\end_inset

.
 There is hardly any hope that a Taylor's expansion around any other value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 will give a tractable result; the trick of using the Taylor's expansion
 to obtain polynomial eigenstates fails in this case.
 Indeed, it seems likely that the eigenstates will not be analytic, although
 it is not clear to me what theorem would establish or disprove this conjecture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The polynomial-basis matrix elements for this operator are much better behaved.
 They are given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
M_{nk}\equiv\left\langle n\left|\mathcal{L}_{A}\right|k\right\rangle =\frac{1}{2^{2+n+k}}{n+k+1 \choose k+1}+\Theta_{n\ge k}\left(-1\right)^{k+n}{n+1 \choose k+1}\]

\end_inset

(Notice the direction of the Heaviside function is reversed, is this correct,
 or an error? XXX Needs double-checking).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The leading factor of two in the above makes all the difference in the world
 for this operator.
 This time, applying Stirling's formula to evaluate the matrix elements
 on the diagonal gives 
\begin_inset Formula \[
M_{nn}\approx1+\frac{0.76}{\sqrt{n}}\]

\end_inset

thus implying that this operator, at least, is not hopelessly badly behaved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between the two is, perhaps, due to the former not being
 diagonalizable except in Jordan block form.

Consider 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f^{(n)}(a)\,(x-a)^{n}/n!$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

 likewise expanded about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=b$
\end_inset

.
 With this expansion, the operator relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=g$
\end_inset

 becomes 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{g^{(m)}(b)}{m!}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\mathcal{L}_{mn}^{(b,a)}\;\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

Without much difficulty, one discovers that the matrix elements are given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{mn}^{(b,a)}=(-1)^{m}\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-a)^{n-k}\left(\begin{array}{c}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{H}(s,q)$
\end_inset

 is the Hurwitz zeta function:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta_{H}(s,q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+q)^{s}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b=1/2$

All of these expressions for the matrix elements for the GKW operator have
 a common form.
 It consists of two summations: the outer summation, and the summation defining
 the Hurwitz zeta function.
 Pulling out this second summation, one finds terms consisting of a series
 of polynomials, which are most simply expressed in terms of Gauss's hypergeomet
ric series: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Gamma_{mn}(x)\equiv(m+1)\,_{2}F_{1}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\begin{array}{cc}
-n\; & \; m+2\end{array}\\
2\end{array}\;;\; x\right]=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)(-x)^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

These have a curious superficial resemblance to the shifted Legendre polynomial
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\widetilde{P}_{n}(x)\equiv\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+n\\
n\end{array}\right)(-x)^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Switching the order of summation in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 gives the following: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{mn}^{(b,a)}=(-1)^{m+n}a^{n}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(j+1+b)^{m+2}}\,_{2}F_{1}\left[\begin{array}{c}

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is taken to be 
\begin_inset Formula $s=m+2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f=_{2}F_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The general appearance and the matrix elements of this generalized operator
 are only a slight variation of those for the GKW; for completeness, these
 are stated here: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}^{(s)}\right]_{mn}^{(b,a)}=(-1)^{m}\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-a)^{n-k}\left(\begin{array}{c}

m+k+s-1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\zeta_{H}(m+k+s,1+b)\label{eq:RM-general elts}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The corresponding hypergeometric identity that comes into play is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(-x\right)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}

As a final note, recall that the Hurwitz zeta may be expressed as the polygamma
 function for integer arguments, where the polygamma functions are the chain
 of logarithmic derivatives of the gamma function.
 Thus, one may also expresses the matrix elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 in the curious form 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{mn}^{(b,a)}=\frac{(-a)^{n+1}}{m!}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}

Here, the curious operator making an appearance is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[P_{n,y}f\right](x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(-y\right)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\,\frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{k!}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{(k)}(x)$

\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th derivative of

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n,y}$
\end_inset

is upper-triangular, with all eigenvalues equal to 1, and all eigenvectors
 being polynomials (or analytic series for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 not an integer).
