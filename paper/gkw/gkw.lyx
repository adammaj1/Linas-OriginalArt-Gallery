\begin_layout Abstract
This paper presents a review of the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing (GKW) operator.
 The GKW operator is the transfer operator of the Gauss map, and thus has
 connections to the theory of continued fractions -- specifically, it is
 the shift operator for continued fractions.
 The operator appears to have a reasonably smooth, well-behaved structure,
 however, no closed-form analytic solutions are known, and these are not
 easy to obtain.
 Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be obtained numerically, but little
 else is known in the mathematical literature.
 While this paper does attempt to be a review, it is incomplete; it is more
 of a diary of research results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Connections to the Minkowski Question Mark Function are probed.
 In particular, the Question Mark is used to define a transfer operator
 which is conjugate to the GKW.
 This conjugate operator is solvable, and can be shown to have fractal eigenfunc
tions.
 However, the spectrum of this operator is not at all the same as that of
 the GKW.
 This is because the Jacobian of the transformation relating the two is
 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $(?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1})$
\end_inset

(x) , which is well-known as the prototypical 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

multi-fractal measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Nonetheless, conjugacy allows the eigenfunctions of the one to be used
 to construct eigenfunctions of the other; in this sense, a

solution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the GKW operator is undertaken.

\begin_layout Abstract
The presentation given here assumes little math background beyond basic
 linear algebra and analytic function theory.
 This paper is part of a set of chapters that explore the relationship between
 the real numbers, the modular group, and fractals.

\begin_layout Standard
This text is a diary of ongoing research results.
 As such, it not always coherent, and is somewhat disorganized.
 It is only sporadically updated.

\begin_layout Standard
The general layout is:

\begin_layout Section
The Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing Operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The map that that acts as the shift operator for continued fractions is
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
h(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor \]

\end_inset

That is, if one writes out the continued-fraction expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x=\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}+\frac{1}{a_{3}+\cdots}}}\equiv\left[a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\cdots\right]\label{eq:continued-frac}\end{equation}

\end_inset

then one has that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
h(x)=\left[a_{2},a_{3},\cdots\right]\]

\end_inset

whence the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shift operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This map is often called the Gauss Map.
 Note that shift operators, as linear operators, are studied as a subtopic
 of Banach theory, and often appear in applied mathematics texts devoted
 to the engineering topics of control theory, stability theory and filter
 design
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Part2004"

\end_inset

.
 However, in these texts, shift operators are typically applied to sequences
 of functions defined on Hardy spaces.
 It appears that the shift as applied to continued fractions is very nearly
 unstudied -- and no wonder -- it appears nearly intractable when approached
 with standard analytic tools.

\begin_layout Standard
The Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron or transfer operator associated with the Gauss
 map is known as the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing (GKW)

 operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}$
\end_inset

.
 It is the pushback of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, and as such, is a linear map between spaces of functions on the unit interval
 (topological vector spaces)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-mink2008"

\end_inset

.
 That is, given the vector space of functions from the closed unit interval
 to the real numbers 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{F}=\left\{ f\,|\, f:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}\right\} \]

\end_inset

then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}$
\end_inset

 is a linear operator mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 .
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

, it is represented by 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}f\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{2}}f\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)\label{eq:sum-form}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This operator is bounded; its largest eigenvalue is 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GKW operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}$
\end_inset

 is a special case of what is sometimes called the Ruelle-Mayer operator
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Flajolet1997"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[G_{s}f\right](z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+z)^{s}}f\left(\frac{1}{n+z}\right)\]

\end_inset

for general complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 This operator, with a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s=4$
\end_inset

, occurs in the study of the Gaussian reduction algorithm applied to modular
 lattices

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Niether the GKW nor the Mayer-Ruelle operators have been 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

solved
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in the sense that there is no known closed-form analytic solution expressing
 its all of its eigenfunctions and eigenvectors.
 The GKW operator has one classically known eigenvector, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=1/(1+x)$
\end_inset

, which corresponds to the unit eigenvalue; this solution was given by Gauss.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kuzmin considers iterating this operator, and shows that given any continuous,
 differentiable function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

 with bounded derivative on the unit interval, that the iterate converges
 uniformly to 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=C/(1+x)$
\end_inset

.
 That is, by defining 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{k+1}(x)=\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}g_{k}\right](x)\]

\end_inset

 as the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th iterate of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{k}(x)\to C/(1+x)$
\end_inset

 uniformly, for all bounded, differentiable 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, as a corollary, this eigenvector is unique
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "section 15"
key "Khin35"

\end_inset

.
 An alternative way of understanding this result is via the Frobenius-Perron
 theorem, which asserts that the eigenfunction associated with the maximal
 eigenvalue is unique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operator is not normal (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}\mathcal{L}_{h}^{T}$
\end_inset

 is not equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}^{T}\mathcal{L}_{h}$
\end_inset

); this is typically the case for transfer operators.
 Thus, the left and right eigenvectors are distinct, although they share
 common eigenvalues.
 To use proper matrix algebra language, these should be called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

singular values
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, although we will persist in calling them eigenvalues below; and likewise
 diagonalization should properly be called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

singular value decomposition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the left and right eigenvectors are properly called the left and right
 singular vectors.
 Alternately, if one considers the operator as acting on a Banach space,
 then right singular vectors form a basis for for the Banach space, and
 the left vectors are the dual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the domain of the Mayer-Ruelle operator is restricted to certain Banach
 spaces, then the operator is a nuclear operator -- that is, it has a discrete
 spectrum, and its eigenvectors form a basis for Banach space.
 By considering the operator restricted to a Hardy space, Daud√©

 show that the spectrum is real when 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

 is real

[xxx need Babenko ref for original discussion].
 As is typically the case for transfer operators, when the right eigenvectors
 are smooth functions, then the left eigenvectors are linear combinations
 of derivatives of Dirac delta functions, located at 0 and 1.
 All of this is explored in greater detail, in the rest of this paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from the analytic solutions, there is also large class of fractal,
 discontinuous-everywhere functions associated with eigenvalue 1.
 The prototypical such solution is the derivative of the Minkowski Question
 Mark function 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}?^{\prime}\right](x)=?^{\prime}(x)\]

\end_inset

A proper construction for the everywhere-discontinuous function 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, and the derivation of the above identity, is given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Subsection
Relation to the Riemann Zeta Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gauss map is connected to the Riemann zeta function by a Mellin Transform:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(s)=\frac{1}{s-1}-s\int_{0}^{1}h(x)\, x^{s-1}dx\]

\end_inset

The Riemann zeta can be written under a change of variable 
\begin_inset Formula $y=h\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s)=\frac{s}{s-1}-s\int_{0}^{1}dx\; x\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}x^{s-1}\right]\label{eq:zeta-gkw}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and thus it seems possible that a better understanding of GKW may shed light
 on the Riemann Hypothesis and/or the Berry conjecture[xxx need ref].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Curiously, the above equation can be understood to be a kind of linear equation
 specifying the Riemann zeta, because the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}$
\end_inset

 is a constant, independent of the integration variable, and can be pulled
 out of the integral.
 For a suitable basis, the integral can become easy to evaluate, leaving
 a linear equation, albeit depending on a paramter 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 in a non-linear way.
 Sketching this out breifly, suppose one has a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ e_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 for the unit interval, so that one can write 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=\sum_{n}f_{n}e_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In this basis, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}$
\end_inset

 will have matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{jk}$
\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}f\right]\left(x\right)=\sum_{jk}L_{jk}f_{k}e_{j}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Supposing now that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is just 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{s-1}$
\end_inset

, and that the order of summation and integration can be exchanged, this
 leaves only the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int xe_{j}\left(x\right)dx$
\end_inset

 to evalute, which can then be replaced in the sum: 
\begin_inset Formula $\int dx\; x\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}x^{s-1}\right]=\sum_{jk}L_{jk}f_{k}\int xe_{j}\left(x\right)dx$
\end_inset

.
 This last is then a linear equation, althought the 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{k}$
\end_inset

 depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 in a non-linear way.
 The collection 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ f_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be thought of as a vector in an infinite-dimensional space; this vector
 depends on a single parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 As the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is varied, there are special values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 where its product times the linear operator is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\left(s-1\right)$
\end_inset

: these special values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 are nothing but the zeroes of the Riemann zeta.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Polynomial-Representation"

\end_inset

 provides explicit expressions for the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{jk}$
\end_inset

 for the polynomial basis 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{n}\left(x\right)=x^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, the integral becomes trivial to evaluate, and one discovers
 a series expansion for the Riemann zeta in terms of the falling factorial
 (equivalently, binomial coefficients).
 This series has many interesting properties, and is explored in greater
 detail in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-zeta2004,Fla06"

\end_inset

.
 The series generalizes; it can be used to formulate a class of criteria
 on various number-theortic series (such as those constructed from the Mobius
 function, or the totient function of the Liouville series) that are equivalent
 to the Riemann Hypothesis.
 This class of RH-equivalent hypothesis were already noted by B√°ez-Duarte

Far more promising, however, are basis functions derived from or structured

\begin_layout Subsection
Lack of simple solutions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from the classical solution, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/(1+x)$
\end_inset

, there do not seem to be any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

easy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 polynomial series solutions to the operator, where a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

solution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be a closed-form specification of the eigenvectors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author performed a combinatorial search of simple combinations and summation
s of rational functions and various classical functions, such as the exponential
, the gamma, the digamma, the dilogarithm, Bessel functions and the exponential
 integral.
 No eigenvectors were found in this way, although, of course, various close
 approximations can be so obtained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The naivest approaches to solving the GKW operator, which is suggested by
 the eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:sum-form"

\end_inset

, is blocked by the next two theorems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
There is no (non-trivial) polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\tau)$
\end_inset

 such that the equation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(\frac{1}{\tau+n}\right)=\lambda_{n}\left(\tau+n\right)^{2}f\left(\tau\right)\]

\end_inset

 holds for all integer values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and arbitrary values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Assume that there does exist such a solution.
 Then it could be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(\tau\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}\tau^{k}\]

\end_inset

for some unknown values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 (which are independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).
 Inserting this into the hypothetical form leads to the equation 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\lambda_{n}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\tau^{k}\left[a_{k-2}+2na_{k-1}+n^{2}a_{k}\right] & =\\
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\tau^{k}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{k}}{n^{k}}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}a_{j}{j+k-1 \choose j-1}\frac{1}{n^{j}}\end{align*}

\end_inset

Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=1$
\end_inset

 in the above allows it to be re-written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda_{n}\left(n-1\right)^{2}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(-1\right)^{k}a_{k}=a_{0}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}n^{-k}\sum_{j=0}^{k}{k \choose j}\, a_{j+1}\]

\end_inset

Since the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 are independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 by assumption, one must then have 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, and for each term in the series on the right hand side, one must have,
 individually, that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\sum_{j=0}^{k}{k \choose j}\, a_{j+1}\]

\end_inset

or 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the theorem is proved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Were it not for this theorem, a solution would have been provided by looking
 for quasi-modular-form-like functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 Another naive avenue is also blocked: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
There is only one series solution to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(\frac{1}{\tau+n}\right)=\frac{\left(\tau+n\right)\left(\tau+1\right)}{\left(\tau+n+1\right)}\lambda f\left(\tau\right)\]

\end_inset

and it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\tau\right)=a_{0}/\left(1+\tau\right)$
\end_inset

 for any constant 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
As in the previous proof, assume a series solution.
 Substituting this into the above, and performing a straightforward but
 tedious expansion in powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, and then comparing terms, reveals that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}=\left(-1\right)^{k}a_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the above had allowed solutions for something other than 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, then one would have also had that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=\lambda f$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Assorted Algebraic Identities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section lists an assortment of random algebraic results, none particularly
 deep; some are vaguely suggestive of deeper relations.
 These are listed here mostly for the sake of completeness.
 These are the sorts of identities one obtains by means of knuckle-headed
 persistence in the hope that that maybe one little algebraic twist will
 yield a closed-form solution.
 These were obtained by the author long before he knew that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}$
\end_inset

 had a name or had been previously studied by others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, notice that adjacent terms in the series can be made to cancel by
 shifting the series by one:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}f\right](x)-\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}f\right](x+1)=\frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}}f\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right)\]

\end_inset

which holds for any function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x).$
\end_inset

 Thus, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset

 is an eigenvector, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}\rho=\lambda\rho$
\end_inset

, then it would also solve 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}}\rho\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right)=\lambda\left(\rho(x)-\rho(x+1)\right)\]

\end_inset

This can be solved easily to get the zeroth eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\rho_{0}(x)=\frac{1}{\ln2}\;\frac{1}{1+x}\]

\end_inset

which satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $[\mathcal{L}_{h}\rho_{0}](x)=\rho_{0}(x)$
\end_inset

 and the normalization is given by requiring 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{0}^{1}\rho_{0}(x)\, dx=1\]

\end_inset

There is a reflection identity: 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=1-(1+x)^{-2}$
\end_inset

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=1-f$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a hint of a relationship between period-doubling and the GKW in
 the identity 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{1+x}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{2^{n}}\left[\frac{2}{x+n}-\frac{1}{x+n+1}\right]\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acting on the monomial, one gets 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}x^{k}\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{(n+x)^{k+2}}=\frac{(-)^{k+2}}{(k+1)!}\psi^{(k+1)}(1+x)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{(k)}(x)$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th derivative of the Gamma function.
 The true difficulty of finding the solution to GKW becomes clear when the
 search leads one to start discovering complicated identities, such as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{m^{2}}\psi^{(1)}\left(1+\frac{1}{m}+x\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{(n+x)^{2}}\psi^{(1)}\left(\frac{1}{n+x}+1\right)\]

\end_inset

or to finding curiosities such as 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=(1+ax)^{2}$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=\psi^{(1)}(1+x+a)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=(1+nx)^{-2}-1$
\end_inset

 one gets 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=-\sum_{k=1}^{n}(x+k)^{-2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acting on a general power, the map gives the Hurwitz Zeta: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}x^{s}\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{1}{(n+x)^{s+2}}=\zeta_{H}(s+2,x+1)\]

\end_inset

 This function is fractal, continuous everywhere, and differentiable only
 on the rationals, where it's derivative is zero.
 There are many ways to define the Question Mark function 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(x\right)$

 Given the continued fraction expansion 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\left[a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\cdots\right]$

 as defined in eqn

This function has many interesting properties and symmetries
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-mink2008,Ve-L06,Ve-M04"

\end_inset

.
 The self-symmetry of the curve is generated by two relations, a halving:
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)=\frac{?\left(x\right)}{2}\]

\end_inset

and a left-right reflection: 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(1-x\right)=1-?\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The full set of symmetries, generating the dyadic monoid, can be exhibited
 by defining 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g_{C}\left(x\right)=\frac{x}{1+x}\mbox{\quad and }\quad g_{D}\left(x\right)=\frac{x}{2}\label{eq:monoid generator g}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and noting that the symmetry relation above may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $?\circ g_{C}=g_{D}\circ?$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, letting 
\begin_inset Formula $r\left(x\right)=1-x$
\end_inset

 one has 
\begin_inset Formula $?\circ r=r\circ?$
\end_inset

.
 These two functions can be taken as the generators of a monoid, whose general
 element is written as 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{m}\circ r\circ g^{n}\circ r\circ g^{p}\circ\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 This monoid forms an interesting subset of the modular group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

.
 Elements of the monoid are in 1-1 correspondance with the Cantor set; alternate
ly, they are in 1-1 correspondance with the binary tree.

\begin_inset Formula \[

 participates in a curious identity.
 This generating function obeys the relation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{z^{2}}G\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)+\frac{1}{\left(z+1\right)^{2}}G\left(\frac{1}{z+1}\right)=\frac{1}{z\left(z+1\right)}\]

\end_inset

which holds for complex-valued 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 (such as, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $z\mapsto z+n$
\end_inset

), and also 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{z}+\frac{1}{z^{2}}G\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)=G\left(z\right)-2G\left(z+1\right)\]

\end_inset

From this, one has the curious shift-over-by-one relationship 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}G\right]\left(z\right)=G\left(1+z\right)+\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}K\right]\left(z\right)\]

One can define an object that behaves like the derivative of the Question
 Mark function; properly speaking, it is a singular measure on the unit
 interval.
 For all practical purposes, it can be called the derivative; and it does
 have one surprising property: it is an eigenvector of the GKW, corresponding
 to eigenvalue 1.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{h}?^{\prime}=?^{\prime}\]

\end_inset

A proof of this relation, including all the required machinery to define
 and demonstrate this result, is given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-mink2008"

\end_inset

.
 In simple terms, it follows from the self-symmetry relation on the Question
 Mark: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(?\circ g_{C}^{n-1}\circ r\circ g_{C}\right)\left(x\right)=?\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}-\frac{?\left(x\right)}{2^{n}}=\left(g_{D}^{n-1}\circ r\circ g_{D}\circ?\right)\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

 which induces a relation on the measure:
\begin_inset Formula \[
?^{\prime}\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)=\frac{\left(x+n\right)^{2}}{2^{n}}?^{\prime}\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

This last is easily inserted into the definition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsection
Miscellaneous Series
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Algebraic manipulations of the above algebraic relations leads one to consider
 various conditionally convergent series, such as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}\,\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)\zeta(k+m+2)=1\]

\end_inset

which holds for any integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 Additional series, similar to the form given above, are possible, and are
 reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-A&S-Anno"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, for example, one has:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}\,\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m+1\end{array}\right)\zeta(k+m+2)=\zeta(m+2)-1\]

\end_inset

There are also divergent series which can be evaluated by regulating them,
 and then taking the limit.
 Examples include 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{t\rightarrow0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}e^{-tk}=\frac{1}{2}\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{t\rightarrow0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}(k+2)e^{-tk}=\frac{3}{4}\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{t\rightarrow0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}(k+2)(k+3)e^{-tk}=\frac{7}{4}\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{t\rightarrow0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}(k+2)(k+3)(k+4)e^{-tk}=\frac{45}{8}\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{t\rightarrow0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}(k+2)(k+3)(k+4)(k+5)e^{-tk}=\frac{93}{4}\]

\end_inset

These are readily obtained
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Crowley2010"

\end_inset

 by considering the binomial generating function.
 That is, define 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
A_{m}\left(x\right)= & \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Gamma\left(k+m+2\right)}{\Gamma\left(k+2\right)}\left(-x\right)^{k}\\
= & -\frac{\Gamma\left(m+1\right)}{x}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{k \choose m}\left(-x\right)^{k}\\
= & \frac{\Gamma\left(m+1\right)}{x}\left(1-\frac{1}{\left(1+x\right)^{m+1}}\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so the above sums are given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
A_{m}\equiv\lim_{x\to1}A_{m}\left(x\right)=\Gamma\left(m+1\right)\left(\frac{2^{m+1}-1}{2^{m+1}}\right)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, let
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{m}\left(x\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\,(-)^{k}\frac{(k+m+1)!}{(k+1)!}\left[\zeta(k+m+2)-1\right]x^{k}\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{m}\equiv\lim_{x\rightarrow1}S_{m}\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

then one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}=1/2$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}=1/4$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{2}=1/4$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{3}=3/8$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{4}=3/4$
\end_inset

; the general expression is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{m}=\Gamma\left(m+1\right)/2^{m+1}$
\end_inset

.
 This result can be obtained by simply by examining the zeroth eigenvector
 of the GKW operator, as given below, in equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:GKW-matrix-elts"

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 Alternately, the general expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{m}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 can be obtained by working with the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}x^{k}$
\end_inset

 (XXX do this and provide expression).
 The above sums appear when considering 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi(1+z)=\frac{-1}{1+z}+1-\gamma+\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}(-)^{m}\left[\zeta(m+2)-1\right]z^{m+1}\]

\end_inset

 and then writing 
\begin_inset Formula \[
z^{m+1}=(z+1-1)^{m+1}=\sum_{k=0}^{m}(-)^{m-k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
m\\
k\end{array}\right)(z+1)^{k}\]

One can attempt to solve GKW by working in the polynomial representation.
 One possible choice is to make one's Taylor expansion about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

, but this turns out to be a very poor choice.
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=g$
\end_inset

 and substituting a Taylor's expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, so that
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{k}}{k!}f^{(k)}(0)\]

\end_inset

and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

, one gets 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{g^{(m)}(0)}{m!}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\,(-)^{m}\;\frac{(k+m+1)!}{m!\,(k+1)!}\,\zeta(k+m+2)\]

\end_inset

or, adopting the bra-ket notation introduced earlier
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ve-B04"

\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle m\left|\mathcal{L}_{h}\right|k\right\rangle =(-)^{m}\;\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\zeta(k+m+2)\]

\end_inset

where we've replaced the factorials by the binomial coefficient that they
 form.
 Unfortunately, this is clearly a very poorly conditioned matrix.
 One can make some progress, if one wishes, by applying a regulator and
 using Levin-type sequence acceleration techniques.
 One can thus find a number of curious identities, some of which we've listed
 previously.
 However, the difficulty of working with divergent sums seems to outweigh
 any advantages given by the relatively simple form of the matrix elements.
 Thus, one is lead to consider the matrix elements for a polynomial expansion
 about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

.
 These are far more complex, but give a very well-conditioned matrix.
 These are: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
G_{mn}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\left[\zeta(k+m+2)-1\right]\label{eq:GKW-matrix-elts}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(-)^{m}\frac{g^{(m)}(1)}{m!}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}G_{mn}(-)^{n}\frac{f^{(n)}(1)}{n!}\]

\end_inset

Other authors have chosen to expand about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Briggs2003"

\end_inset

 but it would appear that expansion about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

 leads to the simplest tractable expansion.
 The general case, of a Taylor's expansion about some fixed point, is explored
 in appendix A.

\begin_inset Formula $v=\{v_{n}\}$
\end_inset

 is an eigenvector with components 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 This beast has a discrete spectrum (XXX need reference for proof), and
 so we may label the eigenvalues and eigenvectors with a label 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th eigen equation is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

The 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th polynomial eigenfunction of the GKW operator is then given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\rho_{k}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}v_{nk}(1-x)^{k}\]

The zeroth eigenfunction was given by Gauss as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\rho_{0}(x)=\frac{1}{1+x}\]

\end_inset

and corresponds to the eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n0}=2^{-n}$

 Again, note the curious appearance of powers of two.
 The zeroth eigenvalue is 1, the first eigenvalue is known as the GKW constant,

Based on numerical explorations (reported below), the series appears to

 In particular, it appears that

\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty}v_{nk}/v_{n+1,k}=2$

 One must not conclude that this implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{nk}~\mathcal{O}(2^{-n})$

 Thus, one might guess at 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{nk}~\mathcal{O}(n^{s}2^{-n})$

 A simple way to arrive at this is to note that 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=0$
\end_inset

.
 The kernel of the GKW is readily demonstrated: let 
\begin_inset Formula \[
k_{n}(x)=\begin{cases}
0 & \;\mbox{ for }\;0\le x<\frac{1}{n+2}\\
\frac{1}{x^{2}} & \;\mbox{ for }\;\frac{1}{n+2}\le x<\frac{1}{n+1}\\
\frac{-1}{x^{2}} & \;\mbox{ for }\;\frac{1}{n+1}\le x<\frac{1}{n}\\
0 & \;\mbox{ for }\;\frac{1}{n}\le x\le1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

Then clearly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}k_{n}\right](x)=0$
\end_inset

 for all integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ge1$
\end_inset

.
 The kernel is in fact much larger.
 Consider the set of functions
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{n,l}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
0 & \;\mbox{ for }\;0\le x<\frac{1}{n+2}\\
\frac{\cos\left(\left(2l+1\right)\pi/x\right)}{x^{2}} & \;\mbox{ for }\;\frac{1}{n+2}\le x<\frac{1}{n}\\
0 & \;\mbox{ for }\;\frac{1}{n}\le x\le1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

Then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}c_{n,l}\right](x)=\cos\left(\left(2l+1\right)\pi\left(x+n\right)\right)+\cos\left(\left(2l+1\right)\pi\left(x+n+1\right)\right)=0\]

\end_inset

and so 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n,l}$
\end_inset

 belongs to the kernel for all integer 
\begin_inset Formula $l\ge1$
\end_inset

, as does 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n,l}$
\end_inset

 when defined analogously for sine instead of cosine.

Numeric Attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can mount numeric attacks on the GKW operator.
 The matrix elements in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:GKW-matrix-elts"

\end_inset

 are easily computed numerically, and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are
 easily obtained by applying standard matrix diagonalization software.
 For example, using the LAPACK DGEEV eigenvalue-finding routine, and working
 with the upper-left 
\begin_inset Formula $55\times55$
\end_inset

 entry block of the GKW operator, one obtains the eigenvalues shown in table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:GKW-Eigenvalues"

\end_inset

 These compare well to previously published values (xxx need reference for
 previous numerics - specifically babenko)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Flajolet1995,Briggs2003,Flajolet1997"

\end_inset

.
 The ratio of successive eitgenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}/\lambda_{n+1}$
\end_inset

 tends to the square of golden mean 
\begin_inset Formula $(3+\sqrt{5})/2=2.61083398875\cdots$
\end_inset

, as given by

\begin_layout Standard
Eigenvectors can be guessed at in various ways.
 One can find, for instance, that the first right-hand-side eigenvector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}$
\end_inset

 is approximated by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\rho_{1}(x)\approx\frac{-3}{4}+\frac{7}{4}\frac{1}{(1+x)^{5/2}}\]

\end_inset

with the approximation accurate to about one or two percent over the domain
 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 This is the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}\approx0.303663$
\end_inset

.
 Numerics suggest that all of the eigenvectors have a pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=-1$
\end_inset

.
 Whether they might have poles at other negative values is unclear; however,
 the idea that the eigenvectors might be linear combinations of the Hurwitz
 zeta function suggests itself.
 Thus, for example, a slightly better approximation is given by: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\rho_{1}(x)\approx3.078\left[\zeta_{H}(2,1+x)-\frac{1.32}{(1+x)^{3/4}}\right]\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{H}$
\end_inset

 is the Hurwitz zeta function: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta_{H}(s,q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(n+q)^{-s}\]

\end_inset

Graphs of the first seven right-hand-side eigenvectors are shown in figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:GKW-Right-Eigenfunctions"

\end_inset

.
 The general oscillatory nature of the eigenfunctions is echoed in the numeric
 values of the eigenvector coefficients themselves, shown in figures

Gross structure

 The nature of this structure is best illustrated graphically.

This figure shows the 100 by 100 submatrix of the entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}$
\end_inset

, with row,column (0,0) in the upper left.
 Each square pixel represents one entry in the matrix; this this picture
 is 100 by 100 pixels in size.
 Black areas represent negative values of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}$
\end_inset

 while colored areas are postive.
 The coloration is such that red corresponds to large values, moving through
 the rainbow to smaller values.
 The color scale is logarithmic, so red-orange represents values of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}\sim10^{-3}$
\end_inset

, yellow-green to 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}\sim10^{-20}$
\end_inset

 and blue to 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}\sim10^{-40}$
\end_inset

.
 Visually, the hyperbolic curves suggest that 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}$
\end_inset

 is approximately constant when the product of the indexes 
\begin_inset Formula $mn$
\end_inset

 is held constant.
 However, the curves are not true hyperbolas; a closer numerical examination
 shows that a better fit is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(m+n\right)^{1.7}-\left|m-n\right|^{1.7}\approx const$
\end_inset

.

The hyperbola-like structure visible in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}$
\end_inset

 is approximately constant when the product of the indexes 
\begin_inset Formula $mn$
\end_inset

 is held constant, and oscillatory as a function of the product 
\begin_inset Formula $mn$
\end_inset

.
 A closer numerical look shows that the curves are not quite hyperbolas,
 but are roughly approximated by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(m+n\right)^{1.7}-\left|m-n\right|^{1.7}\approx const\]

\end_inset

Furthermore, the limiting behaviour for 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ll n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ll m$
\end_inset

 doesn't seem to be hyperbolic either, as can seen in a pixel-aliasing/Moire
 type effect visible in the graph, at about 
\begin_inset Formula $m\approx5n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n\approx4m$
\end_inset

.
 In particular, some of the contours appear to merge along the line 
\begin_inset Formula $n\approx4m$
\end_inset

.
 As will be shown in a later section, where the asymptotic expansion of
 the matrix elements is considered, this corresponds to the non-trivial
 zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the critical strip.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Shown are the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{nn}$
\end_inset

 of the GKW operator along the diagonal.
 As these are exponentially vanishing, the figure rescales these: thus,
 the red line shows the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{nn}2^{-n-1}\sqrt{\pi n}$
\end_inset

.
 The matrix elements are also oscillatory: the overall structure is easily
 accounted for, as shown by the green line, which graphs 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin\left(\pi n/2+\pi/4\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The period, phase and amplitude of the oscillations appears to be exact:
 a numerical exploration out to 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1000$
\end_inset

 indicates that this oscillation holds very precisely.

\begin_layout Subsection
Asymptotic Expansion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The asymptotic behaviour of the matrix elements for large 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n$
\end_inset

 can be obtained by converting the Newton series 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:GKW-matrix-elts"

\end_inset

 to N√∂rlund‚ÄìRice integral, and then using saddle-point methods to obtain
 the large 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n$
\end_inset

 behaviour.
 A detailed exposition of this proceedure is given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Fla06"

\end_inset

; what follows is an abbreviated application of those techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several key steps to this process.
 The first is the observation that a Newton series can be re-written as
 a N√∂rlund‚ÄìRice integral
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Fla94"

\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=n_{0}}^{n}\left(-1\right)^{k}{n \choose k}\phi\left(k\right)=\frac{\left(-1\right)^{n}}{2\pi i}\oint_{c}\phi\left(s\right)\frac{n!}{s\left(s-1\right)\cdots\left(s-n\right)}ds\]

\end_inset

 where the contour 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 surrounds the poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ n_{0},\cdots,n\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 is holomorphic in the region 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>n_{0}-\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Substitution of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:GKW-matrix-elts"

\end_inset

 into the above yeilds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
G_{mn}=\frac{\left(-1\right)^{n}}{2\pi i}\frac{n!}{m!}\oint_{C}\frac{\left(s+m+1\right)\left(s+m\right)\cdots\left(s+2\right)}{s\left(s-1\right)\cdots\left(s-n\right)}\left[\zeta\left(s+m+2\right)-1\right]ds\label{eq:gkw-integrand}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Written in this form, the zeros and poles of the integrand are clearly
 evident.
 It also becomes clear that the right-hand closure of the contour integral
 contributes nothing, since, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s\to\infty$
\end_inset

, one has that the integrand decays exponentially, 
\emph on
viz
\emph default
.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta\left(s+m+2\right)-1\to2^{-s}+\mathcal{O}\left(3^{-s}\right)$
\end_inset

 which over-powers the polynomial numerator and drives the integrand to
 zero.
 Thus, the closed contour can be replaced by a line integral running from
 
\begin_inset Formula $c-i\infty$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $c+i\infty$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re c$
\end_inset

 to the left of the poles:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
G_{mn}=\frac{\left(-1\right)^{n+1}}{2\pi i}\frac{\Gamma\left(n+1\right)}{\Gamma\left(m+1\right)}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\frac{\Gamma\left(s+m+2\right)\Gamma\left(s-n\right)}{\Gamma\left(s+2\right)\Gamma\left(s+1\right)}\left[\zeta\left(s+m+2\right)-1\right]ds\]

\end_inset

The integrand becomes exponentially large for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s\to-\infty$
\end_inset

 and this leads to a pair of saddle points above and below the real axis:
 each saddle is situated between the exponential rise to the left and the
 poles, and straddles a hump between the zeros and the exponentially decay
 to the right.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $m=n$
\end_inset

, it will be shown that the saddle points occur at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\pm in+\mathcal{O}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The integrand and its saddle points is illustrated in the figure

This figure illustrates the integrand of the integral 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 on the complex-
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 plane, for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=n=10$
\end_inset

.
 The real axis runs along the middle of the figure.
 Blue and black areas represent small or zero values of the modulus, while
 yellow and red represent large values.
 Thus, the exponential decay to the right is shown in blue-black, while
 the exponential rise to the left is red.
 Arrayed along the real axis are eleven poles, at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0,\cdots,10$
\end_inset

 and ten zeros, at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=-2,\cdots,-11$
\end_inset

 Some additional zeros, forming an arrowhead, can be seen the the left.
 The saddle-points are located at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\pm10i$
\end_inset

.
 The illustration runs over the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s\in\left[-40,+20\right]$

 The integration contour can be taken to run in the green region, to the

\begin_layout Standard
The integral may be estimated for 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n\to\infty$
\end_inset

 by applying the method of steepest descent.
 That is, one deforms the integration contour so that it passes through
 the saddle-point, following the steepest path through it.
 There, on applies Laplaces method to approximate the integral as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\int e^{Nf\left(x\right)}dx=e^{Nf\left(x_{0}\right)}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{-Nf^{\prime\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)}}\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)\right)\label{eq:steepest descent}\end{equation}

\end_inset

with the integration contour running through the saddle point 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 To be able to apply this, the logarithm of the integrand, expanded in powers
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, is required.
 As mentioned, the saddle points will be discovered at 
\begin_inset Formula $s\approx\pm in$
\end_inset

, thus suggesting the change of variable 
\begin_inset Formula $s=nx$
\end_inset

 and an expansion in powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $N=n$
\end_inset

, while holding 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 fixed.
 To avoid a concurrent expansion in powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, write 
\begin_inset Formula $m=Kn$
\end_inset

 for some fixed constant 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 One may then proceed with the expansion.
 The zeta function terms expands as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\log\left[\zeta\left(s+m+2\right)-1\right]=-\left[n\left(x+K\right)+2\right]\log2+\mathcal{O}\left(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n\left(x+K\right)}\right)\]

\end_inset

The gamma functions are expanded by applying Stirling's formula, in leading
 powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\log\Gamma\left(ny\right)=ny\log\left(ny\right)-ny-\frac{1}{2}\log\left(ny\right)+\frac{1}{2}\log\left(2\pi\right)+\frac{1}{12ny}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n^{3}}\right)\]

\end_inset

which is applicable for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re y>0$
\end_inset

.
 This can be applied in a straightforward way, although to do so, one must
 first write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma\left(s-n\right)=\frac{\pi\left(-1\right)^{n}}{\sin\left(\pi s\right)\Gamma\left(n-s+1\right)}\]

\end_inset

which follows from the reflection formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma\left(z\right)\Gamma\left(1-z\right)=\pi/\sin\pi z$
\end_inset

.
 For the saddle point in the upper half-plane, tht is, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Im x>0$
\end_inset

, one expands 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\log\sin\pi xn= & \log\left(\frac{-e^{-i\pi nx}}{2i}+\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-\pi n\Im x}\right)\right)\\
= & -i\pi nx+\frac{i\pi}{2}-\log2+\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-2\pi n\Im x}\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

Combining all of these elements, one then obtains the following asymptotic
 expansion in 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
Nf\left(x\right)= & n\left(K-1\right)\log n\\
 & +n\left[i\pi x-\left(x+K\right)\log2-2x\log x-\left(1-x\right)\log\left(1-x\right)+\left(K+x\right)\log\left(K+x\right)+1-K\right]\\
 & -\log n\\
 & -2\log x-\frac{1}{2}\log\left(1-x\right)+\frac{3}{2}\log\left(K+x\right)-\log8\pi\\
 & +\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

The first derivative is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
Nf^{\prime}\left(x\right)= & n\left[i\pi-\log2+\log\frac{\left(1-x\right)\left(K+x\right)}{x^{2}}\right]\\
 & +\frac{1}{2\left(1-x\right)}+\frac{3}{2\left(K+x\right)}-\frac{2}{x}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

while the second derviative is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
Nf^{\prime\prime}\left(x\right)= & n\left[\frac{1}{K+x}-\frac{1}{1-x}-\frac{2}{x}\right]\\
 & +\frac{2}{x^{2}}+\frac{1}{2\left(1-x\right)^{2}}-\frac{3}{2\left(K+x\right)^{2}}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

Solving for the saddle points 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x_{0}=\frac{K-1}{2}\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1-6K+K^{2}}+\frac{1}{n}\left(\frac{7Kx_{0}-3x_{0}-6K}{2\left(K-x_{0}^{2}\right)}\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right)\label{eq:saddle pt}\end{equation}

\end_inset

For the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $m=n$
\end_inset

, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $K=1$
\end_inset

, one gets the simple form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{0,m=n}=\pm i+\frac{1}{n}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\pm i\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right)\]

\end_inset

To obtain asymptotic expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}$
\end_inset

, it is now enough to insert the saddle point 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:saddle pt"

\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:steepest descent"

\end_inset

.
 The algebra is considerably simplified by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $K=1$
\end_inset

.
 The final result is precisely that already discovered numerically: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
G_{nn}=\frac{1}{2^{n+1}\sqrt{\pi n}}\sin\frac{\pi}{2}\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\left[1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset

This is an exact, analytic result for the asymptotic expansion of the GKW
 matrix elements as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset

, obtained by using the method of steepest descent applied to the N√∂rlund‚ÄìRice

The Harmonic Sawtooth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gauss map 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 has a distinctive sawtooth shape; the transfer operator of the Gauss map
 is the GKW operator.
 This section presents the harmonic sawtooth, which resembles the Gauss
 map, but with stright-line edges.
 The goal here is to develop a model for the GKW, in order to better understand
 it.
 In this case.
 the transfer operator is considerably simpler than GKW; it is solvable.
 The spectrum is similar, in that it is a countable, discrete set of values,
 but is otherwise inequivalent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The harmonic sawtooth uses straight lines arranged between values of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/n$

The Frobenius-Perron operator for this sawtooth, acting on a general function

The spectrum for the polynomial basis Banach space is given below.

\begin_layout Subsection
Relation to the Rieman Zeta function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The harmonic spacing of the sawtooth edges implies that the harmoic sawtooth
 will be related to the Rieman zeta in much the same way as the Gauss map
 is.
 Specifically, the Mellin transofrm gives:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta\left(s\right)=\frac{s+1}{s-1}\left[1-s\int_{0}^{1}w\left(x\right)x^{s-1}dx\right]\]

\end_inset

The above can be obtained in a very straightforward manner by direct substitutio
n.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Polynomial Eigenfunctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The polynomial eigenfunctions can be obtained in a straight-forward manner,
 by means of Taylor's expansion.
 Expanding 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 as a Taylor's expansion about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}x^{k}\]

\end_inset

and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{w}f\right](x)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{g^{\left(m\right)}\left(0\right)}{m!}x^{m}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\left(\frac{n+1-x}{n(n+1)}\right)^{k}\]

\end_inset

Rearranging the sums, and equating terms with the same power of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, on obtains matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{mk}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{g^{\left(m\right)}\left(0\right)}{m!}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}W_{mk}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula \[
W_{mk}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
\left(-1\right)^{m}\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
m\end{array}\right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-k-1}(n+1)^{-m-1} & \;\textrm{ for \;} & k\geq m\\
0 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & k<m\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
m\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset

 denotes the binomial coefficient.
 This matrix is upper-triangular, and thus has its eigenvalues along the
 diagonal.
 These are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda_{k}=\left(-1\right)^{k}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{k+1}(n+1)^{k+1}}\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=3-2\zeta(2)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(x)$
\end_inset

 is the Riemann zeta.
 Numerically, one finds that the first few eigenvalues are 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=-0.289868...$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=0.130396...$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{3}=-0.0633278...$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{4}=0.031383...$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{5}=-0.0156468...$
\end_inset

 In the limit of large 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, the first term in the summation will dominate, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{k}\to\left(-1\right)^{k}/2^{k+1}$
\end_inset

; the ratio of eigenvalues settles down to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{k}/\lambda_{k+1}\to-2$
\end_inset

 in the limit.
 The alternating sign of the eigenvalues, as well as the ratio of successive
 eigenvalues, is quite unlike the GKW.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The function 
\begin_inset Formula $w(x)$
\end_inset

 is singular at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

, and this might suggest that a polynomial expansion around a different
 point might be warrented, as it was for the GKW operator.
 However, this is not needed: since the resulting matrix is solvable, a
 transformation to a different point does not offer much, if anything.
 That is, performing the Taylor's expansion about a point other than 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 just amounts to multiplying 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 on the left and right by a binomial transform; this will not make 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 somehow 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more triangular
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more solvable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It might be possible to improve numerical stability in this way, but there
 do not seem to be any other gains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrix elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{mk}$
\end_inset

 are easily computed by means of recurrence relations on the indexes 
\begin_inset Formula $m,k$
\end_inset

.
 This is done by defining 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{mk}$
\end_inset

 and observing that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
Z_{mk}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\left(n+1\right)^{m+1}n^{k+1}}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+1)^{m}n^{k}}\left[\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}\right]=Z_{m-1,k}-Z_{m,k-1}\]

\end_inset

These recursion relations are bounded on the edges by 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{00}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{10}=2-\zeta(2)$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula \[
Z_{m0}=Z_{m-1,0}-\left(\zeta(m+1)-1\right)=1-\sum_{j=1}^{m}\left[\zeta(j+1)-1\right]\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{01}=\zeta(2)-1$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
Z_{0k}=\zeta(k+1)-Z_{0,k-1}=(-)^{k}\left[1+\sum_{j=1}^{k}(-)^{j}\zeta(j+1)\right]\]

\end_inset

From these, one then has 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{mk}=\left(-1\right)^{m}{k \choose m}Z_{mk}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $m\leq k$
\end_inset

 .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first few eigenfunctions are 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset Formula \[

 & \qquad+\frac{6\zeta(2)+2\zeta(3)-12}{13-8\zeta(2)}\, y+y^{2}\end{align*}

\end_inset

 solvable, there is no particularly simple way of writing down the closed-form
 solution.

\end_inset

, and can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
c(x)=2-2^{n}x\;\textrm{ for \; }\frac{1}{2^{n}}<x\leq\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\]

\end_inset

Just as the Gauss Map is able to lop off the leading term of the continued
 fraction expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, so this map is able to lop off all of the leading zeros of the binary
 expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The downward slope of the sawtooth just reflects the binary expansion,
 exchanging 1's for 0's, so that the next iteration can chop of the next
 contiguous chunk of identical digits.
 Thus, the orbits of points under this map are completely isomorphic to
 the orbits of points under the Gauss Map.
 This is indeed the very idea of a

The transfer operator of this function provides a second model of the Gauss-Kuzm
in-Wirsing operator.
 It can be solved exactly; unfortunately, it is not trivially conjugate
 to the GKW operator, as one might naively hope.
 Normally, when there exists a 
\emph on
smooth
\emph default
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\phi^{-1}\circ\beta\circ\phi$
\end_inset

, then there is a similarity transform that connects the transfer operator
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 with that for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, as developed in the appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 However, the Question Mark function is not smooth.
 With some effort, one can define it's derivative in a rigorous way
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, but one finds that the derivative is continuous no-where -- vanishing
 on the rationals, infinite on

 The similarity transform is given by the Jacobian

\end_inset

 of the Question Mark, pictured in figure

 -- which can be seen to be terribly singular.
 Put another way, although the point dynamics of this sawtooth map are completel

 these orbits, with respect to the natural measure on the unit interval,
 is

\begin_layout Standard
However, with suitable tools, it is possible to construct functions on the

 these operators conjugate.
 Insofar as the Cantor set is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 and thus allow solutions to the GKW operator to be obtained.

The transfer operator for the dyadic sawtooth can be easily seen to be 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

 Substituting and matching monomial terms gives 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset Formula $k\ge m$

 This matrix is upper-triangular and thus solvable.
 Because it is solvable, there is no advantage gained by performing the

The Failure of the Similarity Transform for the Polynomial Basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under normal circumstances, whenever one has a pair of maps 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x)$
\end_inset

 that are conjugate to each other through a smooth, invertible function
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(x)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x)=(\phi\circ\alpha\circ\phi^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset

, then there exists a similarity transform 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}$
\end_inset

 such that the Frobenius-Perron operators are also conjugate; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}=S_{\phi}\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}S_{\phi}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}^{-1}=S_{\phi^{-1}}$
\end_inset

.
 The transform 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}f=\left(f\circ\phi^{-1}\right)/\left|\phi'\circ\phi^{-1}\right|$
\end_inset

, where the prime denotes differentiation: 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi'(x)=d\phi(x)/dx$
\end_inset

.
 A detailed derrivation of this is given in appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Similarity-Transforms"

\end_inset

.
 Since the continued-fraction shift function is conjugate to the sawtooth,
 one might hope that GKW would be conjugate to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}=S_{?}\mathcal{L}_{h}S_{?}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, the Minkowski Question Mark is highly singular and is not
 traditionally differentiable, and so we cannot build such a similarity
 transform using the polynomial function basis.
 Another way to deduce this is to note that the similarity transform 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}$
\end_inset

, working as an ordinary, bounded operator, normally preserves the eigenvalues
 of a nuclear operator; that is, the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 equal those of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 In the current case, we see trouble in that the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

 are not those of GKW.
 They are not even 'close', in that for large 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, the ratio of the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{k}/\lambda_{k+1}$
\end_inset

 tends to -2, whereas, for the GKW, the ratio is 2.61803...
 (the square of golden mean, see

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Althought the manipulations required to construct eigenfunctions by means
 of similarity transforms break down when one insists on working in the
 polynomial basis, this is not the case if one considers a larger basis
 of functions.
 By properly defining the derivative, one can validly obtain solutions to
 the GKW eigenequation from solutions to the dyadic sawtooth.
 This is developed in the next section.

\begin_layout Standard
The manipulations required to define the conjugacy operator that makes GKW
 and the dyadic sawtooth conjugate require manipulation of the derivative
 of the Minkowski question mark function.
 This derivative is not well-defined if one sticks to the natural topology
 on the real number line, but it can be given a precise expression by working
 on the Cantor set.
 Insofar as the Cantor set is in many ways nearly equivalent to the real
 number line, and that there are many operations that can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

safely
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 carried over from one to the other, one can thus have a workable set of
 tools for operating on an object that, for all 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

practical purposes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be identified with the deriviative of the question mark.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary theorem and mechanics establishing this is given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-mink2008"

\end_inset

, and breifly recapitulated here.
 The Cantor set can be written as the infinite product 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\mathbb{N}}$
\end_inset

 of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

 of two elements.
 As such, points in this product space are naturally identified with real
 numbers expanded in base-2 or binary -- a real number may be written as
 an infinity long string of zeros and ones.
 So:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{k}}{2^{k}}\label{eq:binary expansion}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th binary digit in the expansion of the real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The natural topology for a Cartesian product space is the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

product topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; it's open sets are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cylinder sets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For the Cantor set, a basis for the topology is just given by the standard
 Rademacher functions
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Carothers2005"

\end_inset

 of Banach Space theory.
 That is, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\mathbb{N}}$
\end_inset

be an infinite string of binary digits; let 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

, or, alternately, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}$
\end_inset

 be the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th digit in this string.
 Consider the set of all possible strings, but with one digit held constant.
 There are two such sets, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
C_{k,0}=\left\{ \sigma\vert\sigma_{k}=0\right\} \quad\mbox{ and }\quad C_{k,1}=\left\{ \sigma\vert\sigma_{k}=1\right\} \]

\end_inset

These two sets are open in the product toplogy, and are complementary: 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{k,0}\cap C_{k,1}=\varnothing$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{k,0}\cup C_{k,1}=\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\mathbb{N}}$
\end_inset

.
 The collection of these sets form a basis for the product topology; the
 topology itself is the set of all finite intersections and arbitrary unions
 of these sets.
 It is not hard to see that the indicator functions for these sets are (up
 to a constant) the Rademacher functions.
 Thus, for example: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mbox{id}_{C_{k,0}}\left(x\right)= & \begin{cases}
0 & \;\mbox{ if }b_{k}=1\\
1 & \mbox{\; if }b_{k}=0\end{cases}\\
= & \frac{1+\mbox{sgn}\left(\sin\left(2^{k}\pi x\right)\right)}{2}\end{align*}

\end_inset

is just a square wave.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The open sets of the product topology on the Cantor set form a sigma algebra
 on the real-number line; they are Borel sets, and are suitable for constructing
 measures on the real-number line.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 denote this sigma algebra, and consider a set function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathcal{A}\to\left[0,\infty\right]$
\end_inset

.
 When this function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 obeys certain properties, such as sigma-additivity, it becomes a measure.
 The above collection of definitions and maps allow the construction of
 a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 on the unit interval, that, for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all practical purposes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, behaves as the deriviative of the Minkowski question mark.
 This measure is constructed by considering the one-to-one correspondance
 between the dyadic binary tree and the tree of Farey fractions.
 These trees are identical in structure, and differ only in the labels assigned
 to thier nodes: in the one case, dyadic fractions, and in the other, rationals.
 As they differ only by labels, then the extension theorem for measures
 applies.
 The function that maps the labels from the one tree to the other is just
 the Minkowski question mark; resulting measure is the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 It is illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Derivative-?"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That this measure deserves to be identified with, or thought of as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

derivative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the question mark becomes appearent when one switches over to classical
 notation: one has that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{a}^{b}?^{\prime}\left(x\right)dx=?\left(b\right)-?\left(a\right)\]

\end_inset

The above skims over a fair amount of machinery from measure theory; the
 upshot, however, is to defend the use of the simpler, classical notation.
 Thus, in what follows, we will write 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 as if it were well-defined for a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 It is not.
 However, by always reverting to the language of measure theory, and always
 working with the cylider sets formed on the Cantor set, and then considering
 a filter of cylinder sets converging to the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 given by equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:binary expansion"

\end_inset

, then one always has an object 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 that behaves more or less as if it were a classical function, and can be
 more or less safely manipulated as one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For what follows, the most important property of this measure is that it
 too has a set of self-similarity properties, induced by the action of the
 dyadic monoid on the question mark.
 Of the various self-similarities, the most important one is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?^{\prime}\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)=\frac{\left(x+n\right)^{2}}{2^{n}}?^{\prime}\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

which follows from 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)=\frac{2-?\left(x\right)}{2^{n}}\]

\end_inset

This may be directly employed with the GKW operator to great effect.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is an eigenfuction of the transfer operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

 of the dyadic sawtooth with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}f=\lambda f$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $q=?^{\prime}\cdot f\circ?$
\end_inset

 is an eigenfunction of the GKW operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}q=\lambda q$
\end_inset

.
 The functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 that can be manipulated in this way are in general functions on the Cantor
 set, and not, strictly speaking, functions on the unit interval, except
 insofar as equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:binary expansion"

\end_inset

 allows the Cantor set and the unit interval to be confused with one-another.
 That is, rather than imagining that 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

, one should instead keep in mind 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\mathbb{N}}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 or even possibly that 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is a set function on the product topology (equivalently, a set function
 on a sigma algebra), as needed.
 Considered as functions on the unit interval, these will typically be non-diffe
rentiable on the rationals or the dyadic fractions; or they may even be
 discontinuous at these points.
 Although one is tempted to say them, it is important to avoid phrases like
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

differentiable nowhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

discontinuous everywhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as these are misleading: the discontinuities happen only on the rationals,
 and the rationals are simply not that big a set.
 Many examples of such eigenfunctions are developed in the sections that
 follow.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By using either a sigma algebra or a topology as the base space for a function
 space, the notion of the transfer operator changes as well.
 That is, when one focuses on point dynamics, then one might define a function
 space as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}=\left\{ f\,\vert\, f:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}\right\} $
\end_inset

, that is, as the set of all functions on the unit interval.
 Lets call this space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{p}$
\end_inset

 with the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 emphasizing that the base space is a point-set.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ordinary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 transfer operator is then a map between such spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{p}$
\end_inset

, as previously defined.
 However, the measure-theoretic approach instead requires that the function
 space be defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{\sigma}=\left\{ f\,\vert\, f:\mathcal{A}\to\mathbb{R}\right\} $
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 is a sigma algebra.
 Here, the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is a reminder that the base space for this 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is a sigma algebra.
 Note that, in a certain sense, the elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{p}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

derivatives
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of corresponding elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 is much 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

larger
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 In particular, the elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{\sigma}$

 can be thought of as integrals, over some set 
\begin_inset Formula $U\in\mathcal{A}$

, in that the Dirac delta function finds a comfortable home there: 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is simply the indicator function for all sets 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 that contain the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 To relate these two spaces, one then typically uses the language of topological
 filters to establish a many-to-one mapping of elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 One curious thing happens to the transfer operator when working with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{p}$
\end_inset

: the transfer operator is now nothing more than a pushforward.
 This interpretation gives a nice theoretical grounding; pushforwards are
 fairly well understood category-theoretic objects.
 This preceeding paragraph is again a whirlwind review of some concepts
 from topology and measure theory; more concrete details can be found in
 tectbooks such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
Keeping in mind that the proper setting for both the transfer operator and
 for the Minkowski measure 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is on sigma algebras, we none-the-less revert to classical point-set notation
 to supply a proof that a similarity transform connects solutions of the
 dyadic sawtooth and the GKW operator:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{h}?^{\prime}\cdot f\circ?\right]\left(x\right)= & \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\left(x+n\right)^{2}}?^{\prime}\left(\frac{1}{x+n}\right)\left(f\circ?\right)\left(\frac{1}{x+n}\right)\\
= & ?^{\prime}\left(x\right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n}}f\left(\frac{2-?\left(x\right)}{2^{n}}\right)\\
= & ?^{\prime}\left(x\right)\cdot\left[\mathcal{L}_{c}f\right]\left(?\left(x\right)\right)\\
= & \lambda?^{\prime}\left(x\right)f\left(?\left(x\right)\right)\\
= & \lambda\left(?^{\prime}f\circ?\right)\left(x\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

The above point-set notation 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

works
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that, at each step, there is a corresponding measure-theoretic expression
 for which the equality holds.
 Notationally, this classical point-set notation is simply easier to read
 for a wider audience, without loosing the overall fidelity of the argument.
 Given an eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

, the practical way to work with this will be to work with the quantity
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{a}^{b}\left(?^{\prime}f\circ?\right)\left(x\right)dx=\int_{?\left(a\right)}^{?\left(b\right)}f\left(y\right)dy\]

\end_inset

The quantity on the left may be understood to denote an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 valued on the set 
\begin_inset Formula $U=\left[a,b\right]\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

, while that on the right can be taken as an ordinary, college-calculus
 integral, for which the usual manipulations are allowed.
 Both sides of the above equality are understood to give an eigenfunction
 of the GKW operator.
 In general, this eigenfunction will, in practice, be found to be discontinuous
 on the rationals.
 However, suppose instead one now had not just a single eigenfunction, but
 in fact a complete set of them, spanning a suitable function space.
 One may then ask if there are linear combinations of these that are continuous,
 or even differentiable, with regards to the natural topology on the unit
 interval.
 This last question then spells out the program for the subsequent sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A practical method for picking out the continuous eigenfunctions out of
 the haystack of all possible eigenfunctions is to look for the bounded
 eigenfunctions.
 Specifically, one would look for those 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 which satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{b-a\to0}\,\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{?\left(a\right)}^{?\left(b\right)}f\left(y\right)dy\,<\infty\]

\end_inset

This is harder than it seems, because, as 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(a\right)$
\end_inset

 approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(b\right)$
\end_inset

 exponentially fast when 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 straddle a rational number, while 'staying apart' exponentially fast when
 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 straddle a quadratic irrational.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 has to be very 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

badly behaved
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in order for 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}f\circ?$
\end_inset

 to be well-behaved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Axiom of Choice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few words are in order about the axiom of choice.
 First, recall its definition.
 Given an indexed family of sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ E_{\alpha}\right\} _{\alpha\in A}$
\end_inset

, with each of the sets 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 non-empty, the axiom states that the Cartesian product 
\begin_inset Formula $\prod_{\alpha\in A}E_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is also non-empty, or more specifically, that one can choose an element
 that belongs to the product.
 If we take each 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 to be the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{0,1\}$
\end_inset

, then the Cartesian product can be understood to be a real number; selecting
 a specific real number requires the exercise of the Axiom of Choice.
 Similarly, if we take each 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

, then the Cartesian product can be understood as a continued fraction --
 again, a specific point on the real number line.
 By contrast, employing the cylinder set topology can avoid an appeal to
 the Axiom of Choice: to define a cylinder set, one need only pick a finite
 number of explicit elements (which can always be done); the rest of the
 Caretsian product is left indefinite, and does not require an infinite
 number of choices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Kernel of the Dyadic Sawtooth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The kernel of the dyadic sawtooth is defined as the set of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}k=0$
\end_inset

.
 It is clear that none of the polynomial eigenfunctions belong to the kernel;
 the polynomial spectrum is discrete, and zero is not a part of the spectrum.
 However, if one considers a larger set of functions, say the square-integrable
 functions, then the kernel is readily demonstrated.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula \[
k_{n}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
1 & \;\mbox{ for }\;0\le x<\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\\
-1 & \;\mbox{ for }\;\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\le x<\frac{1}{2^{n}}\\
0 & \;\mbox{ for }\;\frac{1}{2^{n}}\le x<\infty\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

then clearly one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}k_{n}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ge0$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, each 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}$
\end_inset

 is linearly independent of the others.
 Note that the 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}$
\end_inset

 shift under a doubling of the argument: 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}\left(2x\right)=k_{n+1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, or alternately, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}\circ g_{D}=k_{n-1}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{D}$
\end_inset

 is as defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsection
Fractal Eigenfunctions of the Dyadic Sawtooth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Takagi curve can be used to build an alternate set of eigenfunctions
 for the dyadic sawtooth, possessing continuous-spectrum eigenvalues.
 These eigenfunctions are not differentiable, and thus cannot be obtained
 through polynomials, and thus are not visible when working with the operator
 in a polynomial-basis Hilbert Space.
 They can be used to build an alternate function space, in which the dyadic
 sawtooth remains exactly solvable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Takagi curve has a set of self-similarities generated by the dyadic
 monoid
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ve-T04"

\end_inset

; this monoid was already introduced above, in the paragraph surrounding
 eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:monoid generator g"

\end_inset

.
 One of the elements from the monoid is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[g_{D}^{k-1}r_{D}g_{D}\right](x)=\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}-\frac{x}{2^{k}}\label{eq:argument-as-grg}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and it appears in the definition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:L_c transfer oper"

\end_inset

 of the transfer operator: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{c}f\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n}}f\left(\left[g_{D}^{n-1}r_{D}g_{D}\right](x)\right)\]

\end_inset

From this, one may surmise that functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 that are self-similar under the dyadic monoid might be used to construct
 solutions to the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{C}$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, the candidates are of course the family of Takagi curves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Takagi curve, shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\tau\left(2^{k}x-\left\lfloor 2^{k}x\right\rfloor \right)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)$
\end_inset

 is the triangle wave: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
2x & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 0\leq x\leq1/2\\
2(1-x) & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\]

\begin_layout Standard
This curve is self-similar to itself under the dyadic monoid generated by
 the two elements 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 The specific self-similarity is given by a 3-dimensional matrix representation
 of this monoid.
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}$
\end_inset

 as a part of a 3-vector:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
x\\
t_{w}\left(x\right)\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

one finds that the monoid acts on the vector with the matrix transformations
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0\\
0 & 1 & w\end{array}\right)\quad\mbox{ and }\quad r_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & -1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right)\label{eq:g_3 matrix}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The self-similarity may be expressed as a monoid action isomorphism: 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}\circ g_{D}=g_{3}t_{w}$
\end_inset

 and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}\circ r_{D}=r_{3}t_{w}$
\end_inset

.
 To obtain the behaviour of 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}$
\end_inset

 when inserted into eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:L_c transfer oper"

\end_inset

, one needs the action of the element 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{k-1}rg$
\end_inset

 so as to obtain the monoid action isomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w}g_{D}^{k-1}r_{D}g_{D}=g_{3}^{k-1}r_{3}g_{3}t_{w}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be assembled in pieces.
 First, note that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{3}^{n}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 2^{-n} & 0\\
0 & \; q_{n}(w)\; & w^{n}\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}(w)$
\end_inset

 is the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula \[
q_{n}(w)=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\sum_{k-0}^{n-1}(2w)^{k}=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\left(\frac{1-(2w)^{n}}{1-2w}\right)\]

\end_inset

Multiplying by 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{3}$
\end_inset

and applying to the vector, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w}\left(\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}-\frac{x}{2^{k}}\right)=q_{k-1}(w)+x\left(w^{k-1}-q_{k-1}(w)/2\right)+w^{k}t_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset

Inserting the above back into the definition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:L_c transfer oper"

\end_inset

 for the sawtooth operator, and performing the sum, one obtains
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{c}t_{w}\right](x)=\frac{4}{3(2-w)}+\frac{x}{3(2-w)}+\frac{wt_{w}(x)}{2-w}\]

\end_inset

From this, we can immediately read off the eigenvalue as 
\begin_inset Formula $w/(2-w)$
\end_inset

.
 To get the eigenfunction, we need to complete the diagonalization by using
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{C}1\right](x)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{C}x\right](x)=(2-x)/3$
\end_inset

 to get the eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula \[
E_{2}(x)=\frac{2-w}{2(w+1)(w-1)}+\frac{x}{2(w+1)}+t_{w}(x)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above is not the only fractal solution that transforms under the three-dimen
sional representation of the dyadic monoid.
 A complete set of linearly independent solutions spanning the space are
 constructed from 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w,l}\left(x\right)=t_{w}\left(\left(2l+1\right)x\right)\]

\end_inset

Theorem: above provide a complete set spanning the space.
 Proof: XXX details to be done.
 Sketch of proof is that these can be re-expressed as unique linear combinations
 of cosine waves; the specific linear combinations being given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The transform is invertible: 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos2\pi nx$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as a unique linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{w,l}$
\end_inset

.
 By contrast, certain linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin2\pi nx$
\end_inset

 are used to construct the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Since sine and cosine span the space 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 of square-integrable functions on the unit interval, the above do likewise.
 An alternate way of reaching the same conclusion is to consider the Haar
 basis functions for Banach spaces on the unit interval, which are known
 to form a complete set.
 One then notes that the triangle wave is just an integral of the Haar basis
 functions.

\begin_layout Standard
Practical computations with the complete set of fractal eigenfunctions require
 additional tools.
 These are developed here.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is a function posessing dyadic self-similarity, then given 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{D}$
\end_inset

 as some product of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{D}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{D}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 self-similar under the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{f}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{f}$
\end_inset

, then one has the commuting diagram 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{f}f=f\circ\gamma_{D}$
\end_inset

.
 Computations with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

 require the evaluation of expressions of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\left(2l+1\right)\left(2-x\right)2^{-n}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 If the argument is re-expressed in terms of the transforms 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{D}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{D}$
\end_inset

, analogously to eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:argument-as-grg"

\end_inset

, then one may use the the commutation relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{f}f=f\circ\gamma_{D}$
\end_inset

 to easily compute eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 This motivates the development of the machinery below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To perform this re-write, it is sufficient to re-express 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(M-y\right)2^{-n}$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{D}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{D}$
\end_inset

.
 We begin by noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(M-y\right)2^{-n}=\left(M-1+r_{D}y\right)2^{-n}$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{D}y=1-y$
\end_inset

.
 Next, one needs the binary expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $M-1$
\end_inset

; so write 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
M-1=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\beta_{k}2^{k}\label{eq:M-1-binary-expand}\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{k}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th bit in the base-2 representation.
 Of course, all 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{k}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k>\log_{2}\left(M-1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The desired expression is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{M-y}{2^{n}}=B_{n}B_{n-1}\cdots B_{1}B_{0}r_{D}y\]

\end_inset

where each 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{k}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{k}=\begin{cases}
L & \;\mbox{ for }\beta_{k}=0\\
R & \;\mbox{ for }\beta_{k}=1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 are left and right sub-trees of the dyadic tree, respectively: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
L\left(x\right)=g_{D}\left(x\right)=\frac{x}{2}\hspace{1em}\mbox{ and }\hspace{1em}R\left(x\right)=\left(r_{D}g_{D}r_{D}\right)\left(x\right)=\frac{1+x}{2}\]

\end_inset

Functions written next to one-another are understood to mean function compositio
n: 
\begin_inset Formula $pqrx=\left(p\circ q\circ r\right)\left(x\right)=p\left(q\left(r\left(x\right)\right)\right)$
\end_inset

.
 For a fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $M-1$
\end_inset

, the transfer operator for the dyaic sawtooth may then be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{c}f=\frac{1}{2}f\, B_{0}r+\frac{1}{4}f\, B_{1}B_{0}r+\frac{1}{8}f\, B_{2}B_{1}B_{0}r+\cdots\]

\end_inset

If the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is self-similar under the dyadic monoid, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 if it commutes with 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 then the above provides a convenient, relatively simple way of explicitly
 computing the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 one has
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{c}f=\left[\frac{1}{2}\, B_{0}r+\frac{1}{4}\, B_{1}B_{0}r+\frac{1}{8}\, B_{2}B_{1}B_{0}r+\cdots\right]f\]

\end_inset

which is straight-forward to evaluate when the 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{k}$
\end_inset

 are square matricies, such as, for example, those of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several examples can help ground and clarify this.
 Consider, for example 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(6-y\right)/8$
\end_inset

.
 The binary expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $6-1=5$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $101$
\end_inset

 and so one has
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{6-y}{8}=RLRry=rgr\; g\; rgr\; ry=\left(rg\right)^{3}y\]

\end_inset

The bits to the left are all zero, and so one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{6-y}{2^{n+3}}=L^{n}RLRry=g^{n}\left(rg\right)^{3}y\]

\end_inset

For readability, the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 was dropped above two equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider then the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{l}\left(x\right)=f\left(\left(2l+1\right)x\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $l=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1/3$
\end_inset

.
 One then has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{c}f_{1}\right]\left(x\right)= & \frac{1}{2}f\left(\frac{6-3x}{2}\right)+\frac{1}{4}f\left(\frac{6-3x}{4}\right)+\frac{1}{8}f\left(\frac{6-3x}{8}\right)+\cdots\\

\end_inset

while, for 
\begin_inset Formula $l=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{3}\le x\le\frac{2}{3}$
\end_inset

, one uses 
\begin_inset Formula $RLL$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{c}f_{1}\right]\left(x\right)= & \frac{1}{2}f\left(\frac{5-3\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)}{2}\right)+\frac{1}{4}f\left(\frac{5-3\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)}{4}\right)+\frac{1}{8}f\left(\frac{5-3\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)}{8}\right)+\cdots\\
= & \frac{1}{2}f\, Lr\,3\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)+\frac{1}{4}f\, LLr\,3\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)+\frac{1}{8}f\, RLLr\,3\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)+\cdots\\
 & \qquad\cdots+\frac{1}{2^{n}}f\, L^{n-3}RLLr\,3\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)+\cdots\end{align*}

\end_inset

So, for example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $f=t_{w,l}$
\end_inset

 the Takagi function defined in the previous section, one then has, for
 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ge3$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $l=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<1/3$
\end_inset

, that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{w,1}\left(\frac{2-x}{2^{k}}\right)=t_{w}\left(3\left(\frac{2-x}{2^{k}}\right)\right)=g^{k-3}\left(rg\right)^{3}t_{w}\left(3x\right)=g^{k-3}\left(rg\right)^{3}t_{w,1}\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

This method is applied in earnest in the next section.

The Cantor function transforms under a two-dimensional representation of
 the dyadic monoid.
 It is constructed from the step function 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
0 & \ \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
1 & \ \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x<1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

and a weight 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 (equal to 1/3 for the canonical Cantor function):
\begin_inset Formula \[
b_{w}\left(x\right)=\left(1-w\right)\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}w^{n}b\left(2^{n}x-\left\lfloor 2^{n}x\right\rfloor \right)\]

\end_inset

This function is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Cantor-Function"

\end_inset

.
 It is self-similar under the action of the dyadic monoid: the generators
 are 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{w}\left(x/2\right)=wb_{w}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{w}\left(1-x\right)=1-b_{w}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 As a matrix representation, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
1\to e_{1}= & \left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0\end{array}\right]\\
t_{w}\to e_{2}= & \left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1\end{array}\right]\end{align*}

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g_{b}= & \left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & w\end{array}\right]\\
r_{b}= & \left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & -1\end{array}\right]\end{align*}

\end_inset

are the generators of the dyadic monoid in this representation.
 Applying the previous developments, one then has that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{c}b_{w}\right]\left(x\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n}}b_{w}\left(\frac{2-x}{2^{n}}\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n}}g_{b}^{n-1}r_{b}g_{b}b_{w}\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{b}^{n-1}r_{b}g_{b}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
w^{n-1} & -w^{n}\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset

one promptly obtains that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{c}b_{w}\right]\left(x\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n}}\left(w^{n-1}-w^{n}b_{w}\left(x\right)\right)=\frac{1-wb_{w}\left(x\right)}{2-w}\]

\end_inset

From this, one can then promptly obtain an eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{w}=b_{w}-1/2$
\end_inset

 which satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{c}e_{w}=\frac{-w}{2-w}e_{w}\]

\end_inset

Additional eigenfunctions transforming according to the same representation
 are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{w,l}\left(x\right)=b_{w}\left(\left(2l+1\right)x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Applying the techniques above, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{c}b_{w,l}=\frac{1}{2-w}c_{w,l}-\frac{w}{2-w}b_{w,l}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{w,l}$
\end_inset

 is a piecewise-constant depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 .
 Eigenfunctions are then given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e_{w,l}=\frac{-c_{w,l}}{2}+b_{w,l}\]

\end_inset

which satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{c}e_{w,l}=\frac{-w}{2-w}e_{w,l}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We've already seen that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{w,0}=1$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $l=1,$
\end_inset

 one has
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{w,1}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{5-w}{4} & \quad\mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{3}\\
\frac{1+3w}{4} & \quad\mbox{ for }\frac{1}{3}\le x<\frac{2}{3}\\
\frac{3-w}{2} & \quad\mbox{ for }\frac{2}{3}\le x<1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

For 
\begin_inset Formula $l=2$
\end_inset

 one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{w,2}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{9-w}{8} & \quad\mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{5}\\
\frac{1+7w}{8} & \quad\mbox{ for }\frac{1}{5}\le x<\frac{2}{5}\\
\frac{7-3w}{4} & \quad\mbox{ for }\frac{2}{5}\le x<\frac{3}{5}\\
\frac{3+w}{4} & \quad\mbox{ for }\frac{3}{5}\le x<\frac{4}{5}\\
\frac{5-w}{4} & \quad\mbox{ for }\frac{4}{5}\le x<1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

The general expression is given by thie piece-wise flat function 
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{w,l}\left(x\right)=w+\left(1-w\right)\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{\beta_{k}}{2^{k}}\quad\mbox{ for }\frac{4l+1-\left(M-1\right)}{2l+1}\le x<\frac{4l+2-\left(M-2\right)}{2l+1}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $M-1$
\end_inset

 and the binary bits 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{k}$
\end_inset

 are related as given in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:M-1-binary-expand"

\end_inset

.
 The above formula may be derived by applying the techniques from section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Practical Tools"

\end_inset

, commuting so as to use the 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 matricies 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{b}=g_{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{b}=r_{b}g_{b}r_{b}$
\end_inset

, and expanding in powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, and tracking each power separately.
 Note that the sum has the effect of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reversing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the order of the bits in the binary expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $M-1$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}c_{w,l}\left(x\right)dx=2l+1$
\end_inset

.
 In computing the above, it is useful to have a certain polynomial: let
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 be a product of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=L^{m_{0}}R^{m_{1}}L^{m_{2}}\cdots L^{m_{N-1}}R^{m_{N}}\]

\end_inset

Then one has that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma_{b}\left(w\right)=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
q_{\gamma}\left(w\right) & w^{M}\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $M=m_{0}+m_{1}+\cdots+m_{N}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\gamma}$
\end_inset

is the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula \[
q_{\gamma}\left(w\right)=w^{m_{0}}-w^{m_{0}+m_{1}}+w^{m_{0}+m_{1}+m_{2}}-\cdots+\left(-1\right)^{N}w^{M}\]

\end_inset

Since the 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{k}$
\end_inset

 are counting the number of repeated digits in a binary expansion, we once
 again see the insiduous presence of integer series (and thus the connection
 to continued fractions, these being given by integer series).

\begin_layout Subsection
The three dimensional representation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted above, the Takagi curve transforms under a 3D representation of
 the dyadic monoid.
 A few more factoids about this are below.
 Under the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

, the Takagi curves transform as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{c}t_{w,l}\right]\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{2-w}\left[\alpha_{l}\left(w\right)+x\beta_{l}\left(w\right)+wt_{w,l}\left(x\right)\right]\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{l}\left(w\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{l}\left(w\right)$
\end_inset

 are polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $l=0$
\end_inset

 case was already given above; for 
\begin_inset Formula $l=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<1/3$
\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\alpha_{1}\left(w\right)=\frac{3}{4}\;\mbox{ and }\;\beta_{1}\left(w\right)=\frac{19}{24}\]

\end_inset

which is obtained using the methods above.
 The correspoding eigenfunctions are given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
E_{w,l}\left(x\right)=\frac{-1}{1-w}\left[\frac{\alpha_{l}\left(w\right)}{2}+\frac{1}{3}\right]+x\,\frac{3}{2}\,\frac{\beta_{l}\left(w\right)}{1+w}+t_{w,l}\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{c}E_{w,l}\right]\left(x\right)=\frac{w}{2-w}E_{w,l}\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

Since the eigenvalue is 
\begin_inset Formula $w/\left(2-w\right)$
\end_inset

 as before, the general solution may be written as a linear combination
 of these solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previously, we saw that the Takagi Curves served as basis vectors for a
 space of degenerate eigenfunctions of the Bernoulli Map, associated with
 arbitrary eigenvalue.
 We saw that this space could also be spanned by the Hurwitz Zeta, through
 a change of basis.
 Thus, we expect that we can extend these results to this map as well.
 That is, there is a linear combination of the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{w,l}$
\end_inset

 that is differentiable in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $w$

\begin_layout Subsection
Walsh functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Walsh functions provide an orthonormal basis for the Banach space 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 of square-integrable functions on tthe unit interval.
 These can be used to construct eigensolutions to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 This section defines the Walsh functions, and constructs a set of self-similar
 functions from them, transforming under a finite-dimensional representation
 of the dyadic monoid.
 These are in turn used to construct the eigensolutions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Walsh functions are built from the Rademacher functions.
 Define the step function 
\begin_inset Formula \[
s_{1}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
+1 & \;\mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
-1 & \;\mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x\le1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

and extend it to the whole real-number line by making it be periodic (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 so that its a square wave).
 The Rademacher functions 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}\left(x\right)=s_{1}\left(2^{n}x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Given a finite sequence of positive integers 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}<n_{2}<n_{3}<\cdots<n_{k}$
\end_inset

, the corresponding Walsh function is defined as the product of Rademacher
 functions 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n_{1}}r_{n_{2}}r_{n_{3}}\cdots r_{n_{k}}$
\end_inset

.
 It is not hard to see that these are orthonormal on the unit interval;
 indeed, the 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 themselves are orthonormal, in that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{0}^{1}r_{m}\left(x\right)r_{n}\left(x\right)dx=\delta_{nm}\]

\end_inset

These may be paramterized by means of an integer.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 be an integer with the binary expansion
\begin_inset Formula \[
m=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\beta_{k}2^{k-1}\]

\end_inset

with each 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{k}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Implicit is that there is some upper bound 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 above which all the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{k}$
\end_inset

 are zero.
 Then define the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th Walsh function 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{m}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
s_{m}\left(x\right)=\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}r_{k}^{\beta_{k}}\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

In essence, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{k}=1$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{k}$
\end_inset

 appears in the product; if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{k}=0$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{k}$
\end_inset

 does not.
 These are orthonormal, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{m}^{2}=1$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{0}^{1}s_{m}\left(x\right)s_{n}\left(x\right)dx=\delta_{nm}\]

\end_inset

and these form a complete basis for the space of square-integrable functions
 on the unit interval
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Carothers2005"

\end_inset

.
 The Walsh functions have many curious properties; among those relevant
 here are that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{m}\left(2x\right)=s_{2m}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{m}s_{n}=s_{m\oplus n}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m\oplus n$
\end_inset

 denotes the bitwise XOR of the binary expansion of the two integers 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}(x)=1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the non-negative integers form an abelian group under bitwise
 XOR, and the Walsh functions are isomorphic, as a group, under multiplication.
 A sampling of these functions are shown in figure

A set of fractal functions, corresponding 1-1 to the Walsh functions, and

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\rho_{m}\left(x\right)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}w^{j}s_{m}\left(2^{j}x\right)\]

\end_inset

It is not hard to see that

\rho_{m}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=s_{\left\lfloor \frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor }\left(x\right)+w\rho_{m}\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lfloor v\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 denotes the floor of 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 (largest integer less than or equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 Under the action of reflection 
\begin_inset Formula $r\left(x\right)=1-x$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{m}$
\end_inset

 is even or odd, depending on whther the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 bits in 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is even or odd.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 be the smallest integer such that 
\begin_inset Formula $m<2^{N}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the length, in bits, of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, ignoring the infinite string of zero bits to the leftq).
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{m}$
\end_inset

 transforms under an 
\begin_inset Formula $N+1$
\end_inset

 dimensional representation of the dyadic monoid, given by the basis
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

 & \cdots\\
s_{\left\lfloor \frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor } & \to e_{N}\\
\rho_{m} & \to e_{N+1}\end{align*}

\end_inset

In this basis, the two monoid generators are 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

 depending on the number of 1 bits in the binary expansion for

 To be precise, let 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}=\sum_{j=N-k+1}^{N}\beta_{j}$
\end_inset

 count the number of 1 bits in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lfloor m/2^{N-k}\right\rfloor $

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain the action of

\begin_inset Formula $g^{n-1}rg$
\end_inset

 These are easily obtained, because of the simple, bi-diagonal, shift form
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 The most relevant one, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ge N$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula \[

 It is given by the recurrence relation 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k+1}=1+wp_{k}$

 Making use of the property that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{p_{n-N}\left(w\right)}{2^{n}}=0\]

\end_inset

for all

\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{c}\rho_{m}=\frac{1}{2-w}\left(\frac{\sigma_{2}s_{1}}{2^{N-2}}+\frac{\sigma_{3}s_{m_{2}}}{2^{N-3}}+\frac{\sigma_{4}s_{m_{3}}}{2^{N-4}}+\cdots+\frac{\sigma_{N-1}s_{m_{N-2}}}{2}+\sigma_{N}s_{m_{N-1}}+\sigma_{N}w\rho_{m}\right)\]

\end_inset

Here, we've made use of the notation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
m_{k}=\left\lfloor \frac{m}{2^{N-k}}\right\rfloor =\sum_{j=N-k+1}^{N}\beta_{j}2^{j-N+k-1}=m\gg\left(N-k\right)\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gg$
\end_inset

 denotes the bit shift-right operator.
 Observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{N}=m$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}=1$
\end_inset

 always.

From the above, it is immediately clear that eigenfunctions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

 can be constructed from linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{m}$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{m_{k}}$
\end_inset

, and that the eigenvalues will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{N}w/\left(2-w\right)$
\end_inset

.
 To obtain these, one needs the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{m}$
\end_inset

.
 This is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{c}s_{m}=\sigma_{N}\frac{s_{m_{N-1}}}{2}+\sigma_{N-1}\frac{s_{m_{N-2}}}{4}+\cdots+\sigma_{2}\frac{s_{m_{1}}}{2^{N-1}}=\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\sigma_{k+1}\frac{s_{m_{k}}}{2^{N-k}}\]

\end_inset

The eigen-equation is then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{c}v_{m}=\lambda_{m}v_{m}\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{m}=\sigma_{N}w/\left(2-w\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
v_{m}\left(x\right)=\rho_{m}\left(x\right)+\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}a_{k}s_{m_{k}}\left(x\right)\label{eq:dyadic-walsh-eigenfunc}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here, the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 are just numbers, and are given by a recurrence relation: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
a_{N-k}=\frac{\sigma_{N}\sigma_{N-k+1}}{2^{k-1}w}\left[1+\left(2-w\right)\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}2^{j-1}a_{N-j}\right]\label{eq:walsh-a_k}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The first few of these are 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
a_{N-1} & =\frac{1}{w}\\
a_{N-2} & =\frac{\sigma_{N}\sigma_{N-1}}{w^{2}}\\
a_{N-3} & =\frac{\sigma_{N-2}}{w^{3}}\left[\sigma_{N-1}+\frac{w}{2}\left(\sigma_{N}-\sigma_{N-1}\right)\right]\end{align*}

\end_inset

and, written inthis 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reduced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 way, these expressions become progressively more complicated.
 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

, as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, is shown in the graph 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Coefficient-a1"

\end_inset

.
 Putting this all together, the first few eigenfunctions are 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
v_{1}\left(x\right) & =\rho_{1}\left(x\right)\\
v_{2}\left(x\right) & =\frac{s_{1}\left(x\right)}{w}+\rho_{2}\left(x\right)\\
v_{3}\left(x\right) & =\frac{s_{1}\left(x\right)}{w}+\rho_{3}\left(x\right)\\
v_{4}\left(x\right) & =\frac{s_{1}\left(x\right)}{w^{2}}+\frac{s_{2}\left(x\right)}{w}+\rho_{4}\left(x\right)\\
v_{5}\left(x\right) & =\frac{-s_{1}\left(x\right)}{w^{2}}+\frac{s_{2}\left(x\right)}{w}+\rho_{5}\left(x\right)\\
v_{6}\left(x\right) & =\frac{s_{1}\left(x\right)}{w^{2}}+\frac{s_{3}\left(x\right)}{w}+\rho_{6}\left(x\right)\\
v_{7}\left(x\right) & =\frac{-s_{1}\left(x\right)}{w^{2}}+\frac{s_{3}\left(x\right)}{w}+\rho_{7}\left(x\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

Because all of these are constructed from step functions, they are easily
 integrated over: the integrals are composed of triangle waves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several properties of these functions should be noted.
 First, because the Walsh functions 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{m}$
\end_inset

 formed a complete orthonormal set for 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

, it follows that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{m}$
\end_inset

 also span 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 (because each 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{m}$
\end_inset

 contains 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{m}$
\end_inset

 as a term).
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{m}$
\end_inset

 are also linearly independent (no 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{m}$
\end_inset

 can be written as a sum of the others, because each contains a term 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{m}$
\end_inset

 that cannot be cancelled out).
 They are not, however, orthogonal: in general, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\rho_{m}\left(x\right)\rho_{n}\left(x\right)dx\ne0$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $m=n2^{k}$
\end_inset

 for some (positive or negative) integer 
\begin_inset Formula $k.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By contrast, the 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{m}$
\end_inset

 are not linearly independent.
 Indeed, one readily verifies that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2}=v_{1}/w$
\end_inset

, that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{4}=v_{1}/w^{2}$
\end_inset

, and so on.
 Likewise, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{6}=v_{3}/w$
\end_inset

.
 In general, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2^{k}m}=v_{m}/w^{k}$
\end_inset

 so that the 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{m}$
\end_inset

 are linearly independent of one-another if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is odd.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}$
\end_inset

 has a non-trivial kernel, it follows that the 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{m}$
\end_inset

 cannot span 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,3,5,7$

 These integrals are easily computed, as the integrals of the Walsh functions

To recap: the motivation for all of the preceeding mechanics is to find
 solutions to the GKW operator, by means of the similarity transformation
 described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Constructing-GKW-Eigenfunctions"

\end_inset

.
 By construction, the 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

 are, by similarity transform, the desired eigenfunctions.
 Unfortunately, they are not even continuous under the natural topology
 on the reals (they are discontinuous at all dyadic rationals).
 However, since they do span (XXX span what, precisely?), one may assume
 that proper linear combinations of these may be continuous, or even differentia
ble.
 That is, for any sequence of real numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset

, the sum 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(x\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}c_{k}v_{2k+1}\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

is an eigenfunction of the dyadic sawtooth
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{c}f=\lambda f$
\end_inset

 and likewise, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=?^{\prime}f\circ?$
\end_inset

 is an eigenfunction of the GKW, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}\phi=\lambda\phi$
\end_inset

 with the same eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 There must exist certain sequences of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ c_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is continuous, and, of these, some for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is differentiable, or even a polynomial series, although, clearly, the
 last is not possible for any value 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, as the spectrum of the GKW is discrete when the eigenfuctions are infinitely
 differentiable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The continuous ones are the ones for which the filters are bounded: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{a\to b}\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}\phi\left(x\right)dx=\lim_{a\to b}\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{?\left(a\right)}^{?\left(b\right)}f\left(x\right)dx<\infty\]

\end_inset

This condition, derived in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Constructing-GKW-Eigenfunctions"

\end_inset

, is required of continuous solutions to the GKW, and is explored in the
 next sections.
 A sampling of integrals of some of the eigenfunctions is shown in figure

The goal of this section is to examine the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 in greater detail.
 In order to avoid the difficulties associated with examining 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 at a point, it is far more convenient to study the integral 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
I\left(a,b\right)=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}?^{\prime}\left(x\right)dx=\frac{?\left(b\right)-?\left(a\right)}{b-a}\label{eq:q-meas-integ}\end{equation}

\end_inset

in the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $a\to b$
\end_inset

.
 It is straightforward to verify that, when 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is a rational number, that in this limit, 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 vanishes: the Minkowski question mark has zero derivative on the rationals.
 In fact it is very, very flat, exponentially so, with all derivatives vanishing
, on the rationals: this is easily seen by recalling the definition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:defn-quest-mark"

\end_inset

 of the question mark: given a continued fraction expansion of a rational
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[a_{1},a_{2},\cdots,a_{N}\right]$
\end_inset

, that one has that the flat part goes as 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-a_{N}}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 By contrast, the derivative is

Stefano Isola proposes studying a map of deceptive simplicity
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
x/(1-x)\;\textrm{ if }\;0\leq x\leq1/2\\
(1-x)/x\;\textrm{ if }\;1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset

it is symmetric about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)=F(1-x)$
\end_inset

, and has a very simple tent-like shape, and this is the source of the deception.
 One wants to hastily conclude that it is topologically equivalent to the
 standard tent map 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
2x\;\textrm{ if }\;0\leq x\leq1/2\\
2-2x\;\textrm{ if }\;1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset

and thus that the spectrum of its Frobenius-Perron Operator is identical
 to that of the Bernoulli Map, and that this map can be trivially brushed
 aside as belonging to that conjugacy class.
 Nothing could be farther from the truth.
 In fact, it is conjugate, but the conjugating function is the Minkowski
 Question Mark: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F(x)=(?^{-1}\circ\tau\circ?)(x)\]

\end_inset

and so the relationship is anything but trivial.
 The easiest way to see this is to note that we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 are combinations of the modular group element 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
F(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
g_{C}^{-1}(x)\;\textrm{ if }\;0\leq x\leq1/2\\
(g_{C}^{-1}\circ r)(x)\;\textrm{ if }\;1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset

following the notation of earlier chapters, and
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
g_{D}^{-1}(x)\;\textrm{ if }\;0\leq x\leq1/2\\
(g_{D}^{-1}\circ r)(x)\;\textrm{ if }\;1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset

Just as we saw with the second sawtooth, the point dynamics of the Isola
 Map and the Tent Map are isomorphic to each other, but the eigenvalue spectra
 are inequivalent.
 The Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator for the Isola Map is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{P}f\right](x)=\frac{1}{\left(1+x\right)^{2}}\left[f\left(\frac{x}{x+1}\right)+f\left(\frac{1}{x+1}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset

Isola shows how the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator can be constructed through
 some simple operator relationships on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 and so it is a worthwhile goal to attempt to solve 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

.
 As we will see below, this seems to be an even harder task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Closely related is a modular variant of the Bernoulli shift, given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

\frac{y}{1-y} & \mbox{ for }0\le y\le\frac{1}{2}\\
\frac{2y-1}{y} & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le y\le1\end{cases}\label{eq:defn-A}\end{equation}

The associated transfer operator is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{A}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}f\left(\frac{y}{1+y}\right)+\frac{1}{\left(2-y\right)^{2}}f\left(\frac{1}{2-y}\right)\]

\begin_layout Subsection
The (Lack of a) Polynomial Basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on our previous luck, we attempt to define the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 in the polynomial basis.
 First, we attempt an expansion at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

.
 This leads to
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathcal{P}_{nk}\equiv & \left\langle n\left|\mathcal{P}\right|k\right\rangle \\
= & (-)^{n}\left[\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+n+1\\
k+1\end{array}\right)+\Theta_{k\leq n}(-)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n+1\\
k+1\end{array}\right)\right]\end{align*}

\end_inset

This matrix is not triangular, and is thus not directly solvable.
 It is also very ill-conditioned, making it not numerically tractable, at
 least, not in any simple fashion.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 gets large, the matrix elements grow exponentially on the diagonal.
 This is easily seen by applying Stirling's asymptotic formula for the factorial
 to the binomial; one easily gets 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\approx\frac{2^{n+1}}{\sqrt{2\pi n}}\exp\left(\frac{-(2k-n)^{2}}{2n}\right)\]

\end_inset

when 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 get large.
 Thus, along the diagonal, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{nn}\approx4^{n+1}/2\sqrt{\pi n}$
\end_inset

, and the matrix is not tractable numerically, and would be painful to work
 with analytically, without defining some sort of regulator.
 Thus, we are motivated to look at the expansion at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

.
 Here, however, the situation is not much better.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula $y=x-1/2$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{Q}f\right](x)=\frac{1}{\left(y+3/2\right)^{2}}\left[f\left(\frac{y+1/2}{y+3/2}\right)+f\left(\frac{1}{y+3/2}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset

we work through the same set of steps to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathcal{Q}_{nk}\equiv & \left\langle n\left|\mathcal{Q}\right|k\right\rangle \\
= & \left(\frac{-2}{3}\right)^{n+2}\left[\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+n+1\\
k+1\end{array}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{k}\;\sum_{p=0}^{\min(n,k)}\left(-3\right)^{p}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n+k-p+1\\
k+1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
p\end{array}\right)\right]\end{align*}

\end_inset

which is far more complex, and only marginally less divergent: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{Q}_{nn}\sim(16/9)^{n+1}$

 There is hardly any hope that a Taylor's expansion around any other value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 will give a tractable result; the trick of using the Taylor's expansion
 to obtain polynomial eigenstates fails in this case.
 Indeed, it seems likely that the eigenstates will not be analytic, although
 it is not clear to me what theorem would establish or disprove this conjecture.

\begin_layout Standard
The polynomial-basis matrix elements for this operator are much better behaved.
 They are given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
M_{nk}\equiv\left\langle n\left|\mathcal{L}_{A}\right|k\right\rangle =\frac{1}{2^{2+n+k}}{n+k+1 \choose k+1}+\Theta_{n\ge k}\left(-1\right)^{k+n}{n+1 \choose k+1}\]

\end_inset

(Notice the direction of the Heaviside function is reversed, is this correct,
 or an error? XXX Needs double-checking).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The leading factor of two in the above makes all the difference in the world
 for this operator.
 This time, applying Stirling's formula to evaluate the matrix elements
 on the diagonal gives 
\begin_inset Formula \[
M_{nn}\approx1+\frac{0.76}{\sqrt{n}}\]

\end_inset

thus implying that this operator, at least, is not hopelessly badly behaved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between the two is, perhaps, due to the former not being
 diagonalizable except in Jordan block form.

Expansion about arbitrary location
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This appendix provides expressions for the polynomial-basis matrix elements
 for the GKW and Mayer-Ruelle operators.
 Specifically, they provide expressions for the Taylor's expansions about
 points other than 0 or 1.
 Several relations to the hypergeometric series are also provided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f^{(n)}(a)\,(x-a)^{n}/n!$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

 likewise expanded about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=b$
\end_inset

.
 With this expansion, the operator relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{h}f=g$
\end_inset

 becomes 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{g^{(m)}(b)}{m!}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\mathcal{L}_{mn}^{(b,a)}\;\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}\]

\end_inset

which is taken to define the meaning of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{mn}^{(b,a)}$
\end_inset

.
 Without much difficulty, one discovers that the matrix elements are given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{mn}^{(b,a)}=(-1)^{m}\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-a)^{n-k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\zeta_{H}(k+m+2,1+b)\label{eq:general elts}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{H}(s,q)$
\end_inset

 is the Hurwitz zeta function:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta_{H}(s,q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+q)^{s}}\]

\end_inset

Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b=1/2$
\end_inset

, one obtains the expansion of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, which is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}_{mn}^{(1/2,1/2)}= & (-1)^{m}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^{n-k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\times\\
 & \hspace{1em}\left[2^{m+k+2}\left(\zeta(k+m+2)-1\right)-\zeta(k+m+2)\right]\end{align*}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these expressions for the matrix elements for the GKW operator have
 a common form.
 It consists of two summations: the outer summation, and the summation defining
 the Hurwitz zeta function.
 Exchanging the order of summation, one finds terms consisting of a series
 of polynomials, which are most simply expressed in terms of Gauss's hypergeomet
ric series: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma_{mn}(x)\equiv(m+1)\,_{2}F_{1}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\begin{array}{cc}
-n\; & \; m+2\end{array}\\
2\end{array}\;;\; x\right]=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+m+1\\
m\end{array}\right)(-x)^{k}\]

\end_inset

These have a curious superficial resemblance to the shifted Legendre polynomial
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\widetilde{P}_{n}(x)\equiv\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+n\\
n\end{array}\right)(-x)^{k}\]

\end_inset

Switching the order of summation in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:general elts"

\end_inset

 gives the following: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{mn}^{(b,a)}=(-1)^{m+n}a^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(j+b)^{m+2}}\,_{2}F_{1}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\begin{array}{cc}
-n\; & \; m+2\end{array}\\
2\end{array}\;;\;\frac{-1}{a(j+b)}\right]\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Curiously, the above is in the form of the Mayer-Ruelle operator.
 This operator is a slightly generalized form of the GKW operator given
 by Dieter Mayer
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{M}^{(s)}f\right](x)\equiv\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{s}}f\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)\]

\end_inset

Then, taking 
\begin_inset Formula $s=m+2$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x=b$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=_{2}F_{1}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\begin{array}{cc}
-n\; & \; m+2\end{array}\\
2\end{array}\;;\;\frac{-x}{a}\right]$
\end_inset

, one has that the GKW matrix elements are just specific values resulting
 from the application of the Mayer-Ruelle operator to the hypergeometric
 series: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{mn}^{(b,a)}=(-1)^{m+n}a^{n}\left[\mathcal{M}^{(m+2)}f\right](b)\]

\end_inset

 The simplicity of this form can be further reinforces by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b=1$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
G_{mn}=\left[\mathcal{M}^{(m+2)}f\right](1)\]

\end_inset

where, of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{mn}$
\end_inset

 are the matrix elements of the GKW operator as defined in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the same proceedures and definitions as above, the matrix elements
 of the Ruelle-Mayer operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}^{(s)}$
\end_inset

 may be written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{M}^{(s)}\right]_{mn}^{(b,a)}=(-1)^{m}\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-a)^{n-k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
m+k+s-1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\zeta_{H}(m+k+s,1+b)\label{eq:RM-general elts}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The above gets a bit easier to read if one sets 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b=1$
\end_inset

 to obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{M}^{(s)}\right]_{mn}=(-1)^{m+n}\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
m+k+s-1\\
m\end{array}\right)\,\left[\zeta(m+k+s)-1\right]\]

\end_inset

which obviously reduces to the GKW operator for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=2$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
G_{mn}=(-1)^{m+n}\left[\mathcal{M}^{(2)}\right]_{mn}\]

\end_inset

The corresponding hypergeometric identity that comes into play is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(-x\right)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
m+k+s-1\\
m\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
m+s-1\\
m\end{array}\right)\;_{2}F_{1}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\begin{array}{cc}
-n\; & \; m+s\end{array}\\
s\end{array}\;;\; x\right]\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a final note, recall that the Hurwitz zeta may be expressed as the polygamma
 function for integer arguments, where the polygamma functions are the chain
 of logarithmic derivatives of the gamma function.
 Thus, one may also expresses the matrix elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 in the curious form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{mn}^{(b,a)}=\frac{(-a)^{n+1}}{m!}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)^{k+1}\frac{1}{(k+1)!}\,\frac{d^{k+1}}{dx^{k+1}}\psi^{(m)}(1+b)\]

\end_inset

Here, the curious operator making an appearance is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[P_{n,y}f\right](x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(-y\right)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\,\frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{k!}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{(k)}(x)$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n,y}$
\end_inset

is upper-triangular, with all eigenvalues equal to 1, and all eigenvectors
 being polynomials (or analytic series for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 not an integer).

Similarity Transforms

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This appendix demonstrates the behaviour of the transfer operator under
 the action of a similarity transformation.
 The demonstration proceeds using the simplest, most basic manipulations
 possible, so as to be easy to verify.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a differentiable function 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha:X\to X$
\end_inset

, the transfer operator (Perron-Frobenius-Ruelle operator) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}:\mathcal{F}\left(X\right)\to\mathcal{F}\left(X\right)$
\end_inset

 is a bounded linear operator acting on a space of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}\left(X\right)$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 One possible, simple definition for this operator is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}f\right]\left(x\right)=\sum_{y\in\alpha^{-1}\left(x\right)}\frac{1}{\left|\alpha^{\prime}\left(y\right)\right|}f\left(y\right)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{F}\left(X\right)$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 denotes the derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 The derivation of the similarity transform proceeds by substituting the
 similarity relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\phi^{-1}\circ\beta\circ\phi$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi:X\to V$
\end_inset

 being one-to-one and onto (and so being uniquely invertible), and being
 differentiable, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 can be defined.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta:V\to V$
\end_inset

 is a function conjugate to 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,$
\end_inset

 and is differentiable as well.
 Substituting, one then has:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}f\right]\left(x\right)= & \sum_{y\in\left(\phi^{-1}\circ\beta\circ\phi\right)^{-1}\left(x\right)}\frac{1}{\left|\left(\phi^{-1}\circ\beta\circ\phi\right)^{\prime}\left(y\right)\right|}f\left(y\right)\\
= & \sum_{\phi\left(y\right)\in\left(\beta\circ\phi\right)^{-1}\left(x\right)}\frac{1}{\left|\left(\phi^{-1}\circ\beta\circ\phi\right)^{\prime}\left(y\right)\right|}f\left(y\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\phi(y)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\phi(x)$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}f\right]\left(\phi^{-1}\left(v\right)\right)= & \sum_{w\in\beta^{-1}\left(v\right)}\frac{1}{\left|\left(\phi^{-1}\circ\beta\circ\phi\right)^{\prime}\left(\phi^{-1}\left(w\right)\right)\right|}f\left(\phi^{-1}\left(w\right)\right)\\
= & \sum_{w\in\beta^{-1}\left(v\right)}\frac{f\left(\phi^{-1}\left(w\right)\right)}{\left|\left(\phi^{-1\prime}\circ\beta\right)\left(w\right)\cdot\beta^{\prime}\left(w\right)\cdot\left(\phi^{\prime}\circ\phi^{-1}\right)\left(w\right)\right|}\end{align*}

\end_inset

Observe that, for all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in\beta^{-1}\left(v\right)$
\end_inset

, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\phi^{-1\prime}\circ\beta\right)\left(w\right)=\phi^{-1\prime}\left(v\right)$
\end_inset

 and so this term can be brought out of the summation.
 Next, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $1=\left(\phi\circ\phi^{-1}\right)^{\prime}=\left(\phi^{\prime}\circ\phi^{-1}\right)\cdot\phi^{-1\prime}$
\end_inset

 and so one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{\left|\left(\phi^{\prime}\circ\phi^{-1}\right)\left(v\right)\right|}\left[\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}f\right]\left(\phi^{-1}\left(v\right)\right)=\sum_{w\in\beta^{-1}\left(v\right)}\frac{1}{\left|\beta^{\prime}\left(w\right)\right|}\left(\frac{\left(f\circ\phi^{-1}\right)\left(w\right)}{\left|\left(\phi^{\prime}\circ\phi^{-1}\right)\left(w\right)\right|}\right)\]

\end_inset

Define an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}:\mathcal{F}\left(X\right)\to\mathcal{F}\left(V\right)$
\end_inset

 that acts on 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{F}\left(X\right)$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[S_{\phi}f\right]\left(v\right)=\frac{\left(f\circ\phi^{-1}\right)\left(v\right)}{\left|\left(\phi^{\prime}\circ\phi^{-1}\right)\left(v\right)\right|}\]

\end_inset

Then the previous equation can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[S_{\phi}\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}f\right]\left(v\right)=\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}S_{\phi}f\right]\left(v\right)\]

\end_inset

Since this holds for all 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, one must have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{\beta}=S_{\phi}\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}S_{\phi}^{-1}\]

\end_inset

where clearly, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\phi}^{-1}=S_{\phi^{-1}}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the two transfer operators are conjugate to one-another when the
 functions generating them are similar.
 The primary ingredient for the above derivation was that the similarity
 transform 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 needed to be differentiable, in order to make the manipulations legitimate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, the conjugacy transformation leaves the spectrum of the operators
 unchanged.
 To see this, one must switch to slightly more abstract language: first,
 one must establish that the transfer operator is bounded (as, indeed, it
 is) and that it is expressible as a nuclear operator, so that it can be
 written as a countable sum of (bounded, summable) eigenvalues and basis
 vectors.
