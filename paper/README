Contents:

In quasi-historical order:

overview:
    Basic intro to binary tree phenomena. Mostly made obsolete by
    minkowski, below, and other bits & pieces.

transfer:
   2005 -- early draft of above...

minkowski:
   THE MINKOWSKI QUESTION MARK,
   PSL(2, Z) AND THE MODULAR GROUP
   (EXPOSITORY)

bernoulli:
   The Bernoulli operator exhaustive treatment.
   Incluces the Ising tartan, the lattice modeles, the push-forward

dedekind:
   Mandelbrot set as a Modular Form

fdist:
   clip-book of partial results on MODULAR FRACTAL MEASURES

frac-zeta:

gap:

gkw:
    Sawtooth eignevalues and many other results.


mink-exact:
    Exact results on the Minkowski measure.

flajolet:

hurwitz:

de_Rham:
    lots of de_Rham curves

========================================================
unpublished:

category:
    Diary about category theory, model theory, proof theory, modal
    logic.

duplex:
    Duplex category (like the simplex, but for pairs)

entropy: 
    Entropy of continued fractions (gkw entropy)

fool:
    Dec 2014 A foolish proof of RH.  This is the good one, 
    Needs cleanup and publishing!

frontal:
    Hilbert-Polya Berry-Keating conjecture.


========================================================
Obsolete and/or stale:

measure:
    2004, 2 pages, Pascal's triangle as a fractal Sierpinski gasket.
    Very short.  Nothing to salvage, here.

rotations:
    2004, 7 pages, hyperbolic rotations on cantor set. 
    chap-minkowski.pdf covers rotations in a more general fashion.

lattice:
    2006: lattice models and fractal measures
    Mostly supplanted by mink-exact, which actually solves
    the lattice mode.  Includes the Ising model tartan picture
    (which now appears in the bernoulli.pdf paper.)

pushforward:
    2008 draft of transfer operator as the measure-theoretic
    push-forward. Half-baked.  A more modern variant is in mink-exact
    Also a variant is in the bernoulli.pdf paper.

berry:
    Oct 2008 draft Berry conjecture. very confusing. What's the point???

gkw-lattice:
    2010 Short 2-pages confusion about similarity of GKW under
    question mark. Incomplete

conversion from cvs to git 21 November 2014:

cvs2git --dry-run   /home/linas/cvsroot
cvs2git --blobfile blobby --dumpfile dumpy --username=linas /home/linas/cvsroot


git init  --bare
git fast-import --export-marks=../marky < ../blobby
git fast-import --import-marks=../marky < ../dumpy


NO DON"T DO THIS its slow:
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf xacc' HEAD  

YES DO THIS: its fast:
git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter fractal master

mv /home/linas/cvsroot ~/archive/backlot/cvs-2014-11-21/cvsroot
mv converted git to ~/archive/backlot/git-2014-11-21
