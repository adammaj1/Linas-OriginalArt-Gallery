\begin_layout Abstract
Recently, Simon Plouffe has discovered a number of identities for the Riemann
 zeta function at odd integer values.
 These identities are obtained numerically and are inspired by a prototypical
 series for Apéry's constant given by Ramanujan:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(3)=\frac{7\pi^{3}}{180}-2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{3}\left(e^{2\pi n}-1\right)}\]

\end_inset

Such sums follow from a general relation given by Ramanujan, which is rediscover
ed and proved here using complex analytic techniques.
 The general relation is used to derive many of Plouffe's identities as
 corollaries.
 The resemblance of the general relation to the structure of theta functions
 and modular forms is briefly sketched.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inspired by an identity for 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(3)$
\end_inset

 given in Ramanujan's notebooks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "chapter 14, formulas 25.1 and 25.3"
key "Ber-II"

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(3)=\frac{7\pi^{3}}{180}-2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{3}\left(e^{2\pi n}-1\right)}\]

\end_inset

Plouffe describes a set of similar identities
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Plo98"

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Plo06"

\end_inset

 that were discovered numerically using arbitrary-precision software.
 For example, Plouffe gives an identity for 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(7)$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(7)=\frac{19\pi^{7}}{56700}-2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{7}\left(e^{2\pi n}-1\right)}\]

\end_inset

This text provides an analytically derived formula for expressions of this
 type.
 The resulting general formula, valid for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ge1$
\end_inset

, is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\zeta(4m-1) & = & -2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{4m-1}\left(e^{2\pi n}-1\right)}\\
 & - & \frac{1}{2}\;(2\pi)^{4m-1}\;\sum_{j=0}^{2m}\left(-1\right)^{j}\frac{B_{2j}}{(2j)!}\frac{B_{4m-2j}}{(4m-2j)!}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th Bernoulli number.
 The above is a special case of a yet more general formula, derived and
 presented in a later section, allowing pairs of such sums to be related.
 From this, one may obtain expressions such as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(3)=\frac{37\pi^{3}}{900}-\frac{2}{5}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{3}}\left[\frac{4}{e^{\pi n}-1}+\frac{1}{e^{4\pi n}-1}\right]\]

\end_inset

There are an (uncountable) infinity of similar sums, each giving a different
 series summation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(4m-1)$
\end_inset

.
 Taking linear combinations of these, one may choose to cancel the zeta
 terms, to obtain summations for odd powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, for example, combining the above with Ramanujan's series for Apéry's
 constant, one gets:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\pi^{3}}{180}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{3}}\left[\frac{4}{e^{\pi n}-1}-\frac{5}{e^{2\pi n}-1}+\frac{1}{e^{4\pi n}-1}\right]\]

\end_inset

Again, there are an uncountable infinity of such relations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plouffe also notes similar relations for the other odd integers; for example,
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(5)=\frac{\pi^{5}}{294}-\frac{72}{35}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{5}\left(e^{2\pi n}-1\right)}-\frac{2}{35}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{5}\left(e^{2\pi n}+1\right)}\]

\end_inset

The general form for this type of expression may be shown to be 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{gather*}
\left[1+(-4)^{m}-2^{4m+1}\right]\zeta(4m+1)\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\\
\quad=2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{4m+1}\left(e^{2\pi n}+1\right)}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\\
\qquad+2\left[2^{4m+1}-(-4)^{m}\right]\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{4m+1}\left(e^{2\pi n}-1\right)}\qquad\\
\qquad\qquad+(2\pi)^{4m+1}\sum_{j=0}^{m}(-4)^{m+j}\frac{B_{4m-4j+2}}{(4m-4j+2)!}\frac{B_{4j}}{(4j)!}\\
\qquad\qquad\qquad+\frac{1}{2}(2\pi)^{4m+1}\;\sum_{j=0}^{2m+1}(-4)^{j}\frac{B_{4m-2j+2}}{(4m-2j+2)!}\frac{B_{2j}}{(2j)!}\end{gather*}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The methods described in this text also allow for a large generalization
 of these types of sums.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula \[
P_{k}(\tau)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{k}\left(e^{2\pi in\tau}-1\right)}\]

\end_inset

these generalizations follow from a modular equation relating 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{k}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{k}(-1/\tau)$
\end_inset

 for odd integers 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, the derivation and proof of which is the one of the main topics of this
 note.
 The modular relation is not new; it appears in Ramanujan's Notebooks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{multline*}
\alpha^{-n}\left\{ \frac{1}{2}\zeta\left(2n+1\right)+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k^{2n-1}}{e^{2\alpha k}-1}\right\} \\
\qquad=(-\beta)^{-n}\left\{ \frac{1}{2}\zeta\left(2n+1\right)+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k^{2n-1}}{e^{2\beta k}-1}\right\} \\
\qquad\qquad-2^{2n}\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}(-1)^{k}\frac{B_{2k}}{(2k)!}\frac{B_{2n+2-2k}}{(2n+2-2k)!}\alpha^{n+1-k}\beta^{k}\end{multline*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>0$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\beta=\pi^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 any positive integer.
 Berndt implies that this formula is the most studied of all the notebooks;
 it has been independently discovered perhaps a half-dozen times, and proven
 twice as often.
 It has been generalized to 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

-functions, and to rational values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

; Berndt provides a long list
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ber-II"

\end_inset

 of the various proofs and generalizations made.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much of this paper is devoted to (yet another! independently discovered)
 proof of this relation, followed by a series of lemmas that provide the
 connection to Plouffe's results.
 In searching for curious and interesting special cases of this relation,
 one senses that only the tip of the iceberg has been seen.
 Unexplored possibilities include, for example, considering 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\in\mathbb{Q}[i]$
\end_inset

, the field of Gaussian rationals, or from considering Diophantine roots
 of quadratics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of this paper is roughly laid out as follows: The second section
 provides a review of previous related results.
 The third section gives a relationship between the sums and the polylogarithm,
 and thence to an integral on the complex plane.
 The fourth section examines the related contour integral, which is easily
 integrated via Cauchy's residue theorem to give a finite sum involving
 the Bernoulli numbers.
 The fifth section relates the contour integral to the polylogarithm integral,
 thus resulting in a functional equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{k}(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 The sixth section applies the functional equation, providing a variety
 of lemmas, many of which explain Plouffe's discoveries.
 The seventh section give a pair of relationships on the Bernoulli numbers
 that arise naturally in this context.
 The eighth section explores the modular nature of the relations on 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{k}(\tau)$
\end_inset

, followed by a conclusion.
 An appendix gives a derivation of an integral representation of the polylogarit
hm, that is central to the analysis.

\begin_layout Section
Related sums
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large number of similar sums have been explored before; this section reviews
 some of these.
 Perhaps the most forthright is a sum given by Ramanujan in a famous letter
 to Hardy
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Har21"

\end_inset

, stating that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1^{13}}{e^{2\pi}-1}+\frac{2^{13}}{e^{4\pi}-1}+\frac{3^{13}}{e^{6\pi}-1}+\cdots=\frac{1}{24}\]

\end_inset

A generalization of this sum, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n^{4k+1}}{e^{2\pi n}-1}=\frac{B_{4k+2}}{4(2k+1)}\]

\end_inset

is proved by Berndt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ber77"

\end_inset

, and attributed to Glaisher
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gla1889"

\end_inset

.
 This and many related results are derived by Zucker
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zuc79"

\end_inset

, based on the theory of Jacobian elliptic functions.
 A similar result is stated by Apostol in the form of an exercise
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "see exercise 15 at end of chapter 1."
key "Apo90"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1;n\mbox{ odd}}^{\infty}\frac{n^{4k+1}}{1+e^{n\pi}}=\frac{2^{4k+1}-1}{8k+4}B_{4k+2}\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many sums resembling those in this note are given by Zucker
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zuc84"

\end_inset

.
 Some of these are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n\left(e^{2\pi nx}-1\right)}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{\coth(\pi mx)-1}{m}\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n\left(e^{2\pi nx}-1\right)}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{m}\,\frac{\coth(\pi mx)-1}{m}\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n\left(e^{2\pi nx}+1\right)}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{1-\tanh(\pi mx)}{m}\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n\left(e^{2\pi nx}+1\right)}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{m}\;\frac{1-\tanh(\pi mx)}{m}\]

\end_inset

The fount of inspiration for such sums is Ramanujan.
 Sums given in Chapter 14 of Part II of the Ramanujan's Notebooks
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ber-II"

\end_inset

 include entry 8:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\alpha\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sinh(2\alpha nk)}{e^{2\alpha^{2}n}-1}+\beta\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(2\beta nk)}{e^{2\beta^{2}n}-1}=\frac{\alpha}{4}\coth(\alpha k)-\frac{\beta}{4}\cot(\beta k)-\frac{k}{2}\]

\end_inset

and another similar one relating cos and cosh.
 Above, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is any positive integer, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\beta=\pi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\beta k<\pi$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Entry 13 generalizes the sums mentioned previously, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\alpha^{k}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n^{2k-1}}{e^{2\alpha n}-1}-(-\beta)^{k}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n^{2k-1}}{e^{2\beta n}-1}=\left[\alpha^{k}-(-\beta)^{k}\right]\frac{B_{2k}}{4k}\]

\end_inset

This time, one takes 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\beta=\pi^{2}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $k>1$
\end_inset

 an integer.
 The above follows from sums on the divisor function, as is frequently noted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sums involving pairs of Bernoulli numbers also appear in the analysis of
 the Dedekind eta function.
 Thus, Sho Iseki's transformation formula, as described by Apostol
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Lambda(\alpha,\beta,z)=\Lambda\left(1-\beta,\alpha,\frac{1}{z}\right)-\pi z\sum_{n=0}^{2}\left(\begin{array}{c}
2\\
n\end{array}\right)\frac{B_{2-n}(\alpha)B_{n}(\beta)}{(iz)^{n}}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Lambda(\alpha,\beta,z)=\sum_{r=0}^{\infty}\left[\lambda(z(r+\alpha)-i\beta)+\lambda(z(r+1-\alpha)+i\beta)\right]\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda(x)=\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-2\pi mx}}{m}\]

\end_inset

A sum linking the Bernoulli and Euler numbers is given by Berndt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{multline*}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n+1}\frac{\mbox{sech}\left[(2n-1)\pi\sqrt{3}/2\right]}{(2n-1)^{6k+1}}\\
\qquad=\frac{1}{2}(-1)^{k+1}\pi^{6k+1}\sum_{m=0}^{3k}\frac{E_{2m+1}}{(2m+1)!}\,\frac{B_{6k-2m}}{(6k-2m)!}\cos\left[(2m+1)\frac{\pi}{3}\right]\end{multline*}

, and in particular, giving a very similar result involving 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(4m-1)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(4m+1)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Polylogarithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recurring theme in Plouffe's identities is the sum 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{s}(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{s}\left(e^{xn}-1\right)}\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 usually an odd positive integer and 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\pi$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $x=2\pi$
\end_inset

 or possibly other interesting values, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\pi\sqrt{m}$
\end_inset

 for some integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 This sum may be converted into a sum over polylogarithms, and subsequently
 into an integral.
 The integral may, after some difficulties, be converted into a contour
 integral, whereupon it may be evaluated by Cauchy's residue theorem.
 The result is a finite sum whose general structure resembles those of Plouffe's
 and Ramanujan's identities.
 This section develops the first part of this analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find the polylogarithm, one expands
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
S_{s}(x) & = & \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-xn(m+1)}}{n^{s}}\\
 & = & \sum_{m=1}^{\infty}{\rm Li}_{s}\left(e^{-xm}\right)\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

which is generally valid for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re x>0$
\end_inset

.
 The above is easily obtained by applying the expansion 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{1-z}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}z^{m}\]

\end_inset

and the series definition of the polylogarithm:
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\rm Li}_{s}(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n^{s}}\]

\end_inset

The polylogarithm may be expressed in terms of an integral as
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\rm Li}_{s}\left(e^{-u}\right)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\Gamma(z)\zeta(z+s)u^{-z}\, dz\]

\end_inset

A derivation of this is given in the appendix.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(z)=(z-1)!$
\end_inset

 is the classical Gamma function.
 The line of integration is taken to be to the right of all of the poles
 in the integrand, namely, 
\begin_inset Formula $c>1$
\end_inset

.
 Using this in the summation, one obtains
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
S_{s}(x) & = & \frac{1}{2\pi i}\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\Gamma(z)\zeta(z+s)\left(xm\right)^{-z}\, dz\\
 & = & \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\frac{\Gamma(z)}{x^{z}}\zeta(z+s)\zeta(z)\, dz\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The exchange of the order of summation and integration is justified precisely
 when one has 
\begin_inset Formula $c>1$
\end_inset

.
 The last integral has poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z+s=1$
\end_inset

 coming from the zeta functions and poles at all of the non-positive integers
 coming from the Gamma function.
 The last integral shows that the series is the inverse Mellin transform
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(z)\zeta(z+s)\zeta(z)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the integral can somehow be converted into a closed contour on the left,
 then it may be evaluated in a straight-forward way by means of Cauchy's
 residue theorem.
 Performing this closure is in fact harder than one might hope, as there
 are non-zero contributions to the contour from its closure.
 The next section evaluates the Cauchy integral, assuming that the contour
 can be closed.
 The section after that computes the contributions from closing the contour
 integral.
 Upon doing this, Plouffe's identities, and many more, become available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Contour Integral
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Define the contour integral as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
I_{s}(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\gamma}\frac{\Gamma(z)}{x^{z}}\zeta(z+s)\zeta(z)dz\]

\end_inset

where the contour 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 encircles the poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $z+s=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0,-1,-2,\ldots$
\end_inset

 in the usual, right-handed fashion.
 Then, one uses Cauchy's theorem, which states that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(a)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint\,\frac{f(z)}{z-a}\, dz\]

\end_inset

for simple poles, and that
\begin_inset Formula \[
f^{\,\prime}(a)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint\,\frac{f(z)}{\left(z-a\right)^{2}}\, dz\]

\end_inset

for double poles.
 For the pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

, one obtains the residue
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\rm Res}(z=1)=\frac{\zeta(s+1)}{x}\]

\end_inset

For the poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-n$
\end_inset

, one obtains the residue
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\rm Res}(z=-n)=\frac{(-x)^{n}}{n!}\zeta(s-n)\zeta(-n)\]

\end_inset

and so one has
\begin_inset Formula \[
I_{s}(x)={\rm Res}(z=1-s)+\frac{\zeta(s+1)}{x}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-x)^{n}}{n!}\zeta(s-n)\zeta(-n)\]

\end_inset

For 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 not an integer, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\rm Res}(z=1-s)=\frac{\Gamma(1-s)}{x^{1-s}}\zeta(1-s)\]

\end_inset

However, the interesting case is for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=k$
\end_inset

 a positive integer.
 In this case, the pole overlays another pole from the Gamma, and one has
 a double pole.
 This is just a little trickier to evaluate:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{z=1-k}\frac{\Gamma(z)}{x^{z}}\zeta(z+s)\zeta(z)dz & = & \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{z=1-k}\frac{f(z)}{(z+k-1)^{2}}dz\\
 & = & \left.\frac{d}{dz}\left[(z+k-1)^{2}\Gamma(z)\;\zeta(z+k)\frac{\zeta(z)}{x^{z}}\right]\right|_{z=1-k}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

To perform the derivative, one will need to use the identities
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\frac{d}{ds}(s-1)\zeta(s)\right|_{s=1}=\gamma\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0.577\ldots$
\end_inset

 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\frac{d}{dz}(z+n)\Gamma(z)\right|_{z=-n}=(-1)^{n}\,\frac{\psi(n+1)}{\Gamma(n+1)}=(-1)^{n}\,\frac{H_{n}-\gamma}{n!}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(z)$
\end_inset

 is the digamma function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th harmonic number.
 Putting these together, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{z=1-k}\frac{\Gamma(z)}{x^{z}}\zeta(z+s)\zeta(z)dz=\frac{(-x)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}\left[\zeta^{\prime}(1-k)+\left(H_{k-1}-\ln2\pi\right)\zeta(1-k)\right]\]

\end_inset

Adding this to the other contributions, one gets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
I_{k}(x) & = & \frac{\zeta(k+1)}{x}+\!\sum_{\begin{array}{c}
n=0\\
n\ne k-1\end{array}}^{\infty}\!\frac{(-x)^{n}}{n!}\zeta(k-n)\zeta(-n)\\
 &  & +\,\frac{(-x)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}\left[\zeta^{\prime}(1-k)+\left(H_{k-1}-\ln2\pi\right)\zeta(1-k)\right]\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

When 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is an odd integer, the above simplifies in two ways.
 First, 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(1-k)$
\end_inset

 vanishes, because the zeta function vanishes at all negative even integers.
 Similarly, the infinite sum becomes finite: when 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is an odd integer, one has either 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(k-n)=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(-n)=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n>k$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, for 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 an odd integer, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
I_{k}(x)=\frac{\zeta(k+1)}{x}+\!\sum_{\begin{array}{c}
n=0\\
n\ne k-1\end{array}}^{k}\!\frac{(-x)^{n}}{n!}\zeta(k-n)\zeta(-n)+\frac{(-x)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}\zeta^{\prime}(1-k)\]

\end_inset

For the remainder of the paper, it is assumed that, in this context, 
\begin_inset Formula $k>1$
\end_inset

 is an odd integer, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
 The above evaluation of the contour integral is the main result of this
 section.
 To see that this is a key result, one may substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $k=3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x=2\pi$
\end_inset

 to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \[
I_{3}(2\pi)=-\zeta(3)+\frac{7\pi^{3}}{180}\]

\end_inset

which should be recognizable as a portion of Ramanujan's identity.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $k=7$
\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
I_{7}(2\pi)=-\zeta(7)+\frac{19\pi^{7}}{56700}\]

\end_inset

which resembles one of the results given by Plouffe.
 To complete the connection, one must relate the contour integral 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{k}(x)$
\end_inset

 to the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 This is done in the next section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, however, to drive the point home, one must observe that most of the
 terms in the above expression are rational multiples of powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 This follows from the zeta function being related to the Bernoulli numbers
 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}$
\end_inset

 at even integers:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(2n)=(-1)^{n+1}\frac{(2\pi)^{2n}B_{2n}}{2(2n)!}\]

\end_inset

for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ge0$
\end_inset

.
 At the negative values, one has
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(-n)=-\frac{B_{n+1}}{n+1}\]

\end_inset

while the derivative is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta^{\prime}(-2n)=(-1)^{n}\frac{(2n)!}{2(2\pi)^{2n}}\zeta(2n+1)\]

\end_inset

for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n>1$
\end_inset

.
 Using these in the above expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{k}(x)$
\end_inset

, and rearranging terms a bit, one gets 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
-2I_{k}(x) & = & \zeta(k)\left[1-\left(\frac{x}{2\pi i}\right)^{k-1}\right]\\
 & + & \frac{1}{x\;(k+1)!}\;\sum_{j=0}^{(k+1)/2}\left(\!\begin{array}{c}
k+1\\
2j\end{array}\!\right)x^{2j}\left(2\pi i\right)^{k+1-2j}B_{2j}B_{k+1-2j}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The above introduces the binomial coefficient
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\!\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\!\right)=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\]

\end_inset

Although the imaginary number 
\begin_inset Formula $i=\sqrt{-1}$
\end_inset

 appears in the above, it is always squared, and thus is just a sign-keeping
 device.
 Every term in the sum is purely real.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the contour integral is written in this form, it may now be seen that
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 being any rational multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $x=p\pi/q$
\end_inset

 for any integers 
\begin_inset Formula $p,q$
\end_inset

, that the coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(k)$
\end_inset

 is a rational number, and that the second term is another rational times
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{k}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A further curiosity in this regard is noted by Plouffe: if one takes 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\pi\sqrt{p/q}$
\end_inset

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, one also gets simple expressions: because 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is odd, the coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(k)$
\end_inset

 is still a rational, and the coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{k}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{p/q}$
\end_inset

 times some rational.
 For rational 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, one still has that the sum is a rational polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{2}$
\end_inset

, and for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sqrt{\pi p/q}$
\end_inset

, one still has that the sum is a rational polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 The ocean-full of rationals here suggest that some sort of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic analysis might be interesting.
 The appearance of the square root suggests that there is a relation to
 complex multiplication, or that one may have interesting results on the
 field of Gaussian integers.

\begin_layout Section
Evaluating the Contour Integral
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this section is to relate the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}(x)$
\end_inset

 to the contour integral 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{k}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
For odd integers 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{k}(x)=I_{k}(x)+(-1)^{(k-1)/2}\left(\frac{x}{2\pi}\right)^{k-1}S_{k}\left(\frac{4\pi^{2}}{x}\right)\]

\end_inset

For the remainder of this text, this will be referred to as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functional equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
To prove this result, consider evaluating the contour integral 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{s}(x)$
\end_inset

 for a tall rectangular contour surrounding the poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1,0,-1,\ldots,1-s$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, write 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{s}(x)=A+B+C+D$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 being the integral from 
\begin_inset Formula $c-ih$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $c+ih$
\end_inset

 for a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $c>1$
\end_inset

 and the height 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 large, eventually taking the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $h\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 forms the right hand side of the rectangular contour.
 In the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $h\to\infty$
\end_inset

, one has by definition 
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=S_{s}(x)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 be the top and bottom of the contour, so that for 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, the integral runs from 
\begin_inset Formula $c+ih$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $ih-s-\epsilon$
\end_inset

 leftwards.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

, the integral runs rightwards from 
\begin_inset Formula $-ih-s-\epsilon$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $c-ih$
\end_inset

; here we take 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset

.
 The integral 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 on the left hand side of the rectangle closes the contour, running downwards,
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $ih-s-\epsilon$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $-ih-s-\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The integrals 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 will vanish in the limit of the height 
\begin_inset Formula $h\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 This can be easily seen after a simple change of variable: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
B & = & \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{ih+c}^{ih-s-\epsilon}\frac{\Gamma(z)}{x^{z}}\zeta(s+z)\zeta(z)\, dz\\
 & = & \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c}^{-s-\epsilon}\frac{\Gamma(u+ih)}{x^{u+ih}}\zeta(s+u+ih)\zeta(u+ih)\, du\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Much of the integrand is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(1)$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, or polynomially thereabouts.
 The integrand is dominated by the Gamma function, which, from Stirling's
 approximation, may be seen to be 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma(u+ih)=\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-\pi h/2}\right)\]

\end_inset

The complex conjugate argument applies to 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

, and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 vanish in the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $h\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
To evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, begin by writing
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
D & = & -\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{-ih-s-\epsilon}^{ih-s-\epsilon}\frac{\Gamma(z)}{x^{z}}\zeta(s+z)\zeta(z)\, dz\\
 & = & -\frac{1}{2\pi i}x^{s+\epsilon}\int_{-ih}^{ih}x^{u}\Gamma(-u-s-\epsilon)\zeta(-u-\epsilon)\zeta(-u-s-\epsilon)\, du\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

after a change of variable 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-u-s-\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 One then applies the functional equations for Gamma:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma(1-z)\Gamma(z)=\frac{\pi}{\sin\pi z}\]

\end_inset

and for zeta:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(s)=2^{s}\pi^{s-1}\sin\frac{\pi s}{2}\Gamma(1-s)\zeta(1-s)\]

\end_inset

to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
D & =\frac{1}{2\pi^{2}i}\left(\frac{x}{2\pi}\right)^{s+\epsilon}\left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\right)^{\epsilon}\int_{-ih}^{ih}\left(\frac{x}{4\pi^{2}}\right)^{u} & \frac{\sin\frac{u+\epsilon}{2}\pi\;\sin\frac{u+s+\epsilon}{2}\pi}{\sin(u+s+\epsilon)\pi}\;\times\\
 &  & \Gamma(1+u+\epsilon)\zeta(1+u+\epsilon)\zeta(1+s+u+\epsilon)\, du\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Another change of variable, this time as 
\begin_inset Formula $w=1+u+\epsilon$
\end_inset

, takes the integral to a slightly more recognizable form: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
D=-\frac{1}{\pi i}\left(\frac{x}{2\pi}\right)^{s-1}\int_{1+\epsilon-ih}^{1+\epsilon+ih}\left(\frac{x}{4\pi^{2}}\right)^{w}\frac{\cos\frac{w}{2}\pi\;\cos\frac{w+s}{2}\pi}{\sin(w+s)\pi}\Gamma(w)\zeta(w)\zeta(w+s)\, dw\]

\end_inset

Next, by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $s=k$
\end_inset

 to be an odd integer, the trigonometric piece simplifies and looses its
 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 dependence: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\cos\frac{w}{2}\pi\;\cos\frac{w+k}{2}\pi}{\sin(w+k)\pi}=\frac{1}{2}(-1)^{(k+1)/2}\]

\end_inset

Pulling out this piece, one regains a recognizable integral, so that, in
 the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $h\to\infty$
\end_inset

, one finally reaches the claimed result:
\begin_inset Formula \[
D=(-1)^{(k+1)/2}\left(\frac{x}{2\pi}\right)^{k-1}S_{k}\left(\frac{4\pi^{2}}{x}\right)\]

\end_inset

that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
I_{k}(x)=A+D=S_{k}(x)-(-1)^{(k-1)/2}\left(\frac{x}{2\pi}\right)^{k-1}S_{k}\left(\frac{4\pi^{2}}{x}\right)\]

\end_inset

for odd integer 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next section will review the application of this and the preceding sections
 to specific, simple values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, thus regaining many of Plouffe's sums.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Lemmas and Applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first corollary demonstrates Plouffe's simplest sums for 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(4m-1)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
For 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 integer, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
I_{4m-1}(2\pi)=2S_{4m-1}(2\pi).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $x=2\pi$
\end_inset

 in the functional equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This corollary provides the first concrete result of this exposition, namely
 that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{4m-1}\left(e^{2\pi n}-1\right)}=-\zeta(4m-1)+\frac{(2\pi)^{4m-1}}{(4m)!}\;\sum_{j=0}^{2m}\left(\begin{array}{c}
4m\\
2j\end{array}\right)\left(-1\right)^{j}B_{2j}B_{4m-2j}\]

\end_inset

which completely resolves one set of relationships given by Plouffe.
 The functional equation opens additional possibilities.
 By substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $x=2\pi p/q$
\end_inset

, one obtains, for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=4m-1$
\end_inset

, that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
q^{k-1}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{k}\left(e^{2\pi pn/q}-1\right)}+p^{k-1}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{k}\left(e^{2\pi qn/p}-1\right)}=q^{k-1}I_{k}\left(\frac{2\pi p}{q}\right)\]

\end_inset

Thus, for example, by choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k=3$
\end_inset

, on obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(3)=\frac{37\pi^{3}}{900}-\frac{2}{5}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{3}}\left[\frac{4}{e^{\pi n}-1}+\frac{1}{e^{4\pi n}-1}\right]\]

\end_inset

and similarly, for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=7$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(7)=\frac{409\pi^{7}}{94500}-\frac{2}{5}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{7}}\left[\frac{4}{e^{\pi n}-1}+\frac{1}{e^{4\pi n}-1}\right]\]

\end_inset

and one may proceed in a similar manner.
 There are an uncountable infinity of such relations (since 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 need not be rational).
 One may take arbitrary linear combinations of these; or if one desires,
 one may subtract to cancel out zeta terms, leaving behind an (uncountable)
 infinity of relations for powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next corollary shows that something more is needed for 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(5)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(9)$
\end_inset

, and so on, since the most direct approach does not give any information
 for such sums.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
For 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 an odd integer, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
I_{k}(x)=(-1)^{(k+1)/2}\left(\frac{4\pi^{2}}{x}\right)^{k-1}I_{k}\left(\frac{4\pi^{2}}{x}\right)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This may be proved by applying the functional equation twice in a row.
 That is, it may be proved by substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $x\to4\pi^{2}/x$
\end_inset

 in the functional equation and then employing the result.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
For 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 a positive integer, one has
\begin_inset Formula \[
I_{4m+1}(2\pi)=0.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $x=2\pi$
\end_inset

 in the preceding corollary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following directly from the above is another corollary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
For 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 a positive integer, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\sum_{j=0}^{2m+1}(-1)^{j}\frac{B_{4m-2j+2}}{(4m-2j+2)!}\frac{B_{2j}}{(2j)!}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Write out the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{4m+1}(2\pi)$
\end_inset

 in detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the above, it should be clear that the functional equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}$
\end_inset

 does not provide any statements about 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $k=4m+1$
\end_inset

.
 To obtain results on sums involving 
\begin_inset Formula $k=4m+1$
\end_inset

, one must introduce
\begin_inset Formula \[
T_{s}(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{s}\left(e^{xn}+1\right)}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
One has
\begin_inset Formula \[
T_{s}(x)=S_{s}(x)-2S_{s}(2x)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This may be proved by re-writing in terms of the polylogarithm, along the
 lines of the earlier development: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
T_{s}(x)=-\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{m}{\rm Li}_{s}\left(e^{-xm}\right)\]

\end_inset

The even and odd terms are regrouped, as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
T_{s}(x)=\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}{\rm Li}_{s}\left(e^{-xm}\right)-2{\rm Li}_{s}\left(e^{-2xm}\right)\]

\end_inset

which is seen to be a sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{s}$
\end_inset

's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results for 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(5)$
\end_inset

, etc.
 follow from a critical observation: that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{s}(x+2\pi i)=S_{s}(x)\]

\end_inset

is a periodic function.
 This periodicity is employed directly in the next theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
For positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
S_{4m+1}(2\pi) & = & I_{4m+1}(2\pi(1+i))\\
 &  & +(-1)^{m}\left[\frac{T_{4m+1}(2\pi)}{4^{m}}+2\cdot4^{m}S_{4m+1}(2\pi)-4^{m}I_{4m+1}(\pi)\right]\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Using periodicity, one writes, for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=4m+1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{k}(2\pi+2\pi i)=S_{k}(2\pi)=I_{k}(2\pi(1+i))+2^{(k-1)/2}e^{3i\pi(k-1)/4}S_{k}(\pi(1-i))\]

\end_inset

The series 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}(\pi(1-i))$
\end_inset

 doesn't have an imaginary part; rather, it is an alternating series, which
 may be expanded and written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{k}(\pi(1-i))=-T_{k}(\pi)+\frac{T_{k}(2\pi)+S_{k}(2\pi)}{2^{k}}\]

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}(\pi)$
\end_inset

 term may be eliminated by writing 
\begin_inset Formula \[
T_{k}(\pi)=S_{k}(\pi)-2S_{k}(2\pi)\]

\end_inset

and the 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}(\pi)$
\end_inset

 term may be eliminated by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
S_{k}(\pi) & = & I_{k}(\pi)+2^{1-k}S_{k}(4\pi)\\
 & = & I_{k}(\pi)+2^{-k}\left[S_{k}(2\pi)-T_{k}(2\pi)\right]\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Performing the various substitutions suggested above proves the theorem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example of the application of the above theorem, take 
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $k=5$
\end_inset

.
 One easily finds that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
I_{5}(\pi)=-\frac{15}{32}\zeta(5)+\frac{\pi^{5}}{9\cdot64}\]

\end_inset

and that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
I_{5}(2\pi(1+i))=-\frac{5}{2}\zeta(5)+\frac{\pi^{5}}{9\cdot15}\]

\end_inset

Combining these, one gets
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(5)=\frac{\pi^{5}}{294}-\frac{2}{35}\left[T_{5}(2\pi)+36S_{5}(2\pi)\right]\]

\end_inset

which is given by Plouffe.
 The theorem may be used to generate similar expressions for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(4m+1)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Curiously, the theorem yields results for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

 as well.
 In this case, one finds 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{1}(2\pi)+T_{1}(2\pi)=\frac{\pi}{6}-\frac{3}{4}\log2\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many identities for 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 are possible by taking two different expressions for a given zeta, and
 subtracting them, leaving behind a rational combination of the sums and
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, for example, the following theorem for Apéry's constant:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
A series expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{3}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\pi^{3}=720\cdot S_{3}(\pi)-900\cdot S_{3}(2\pi)+180\cdot S_{3}(4\pi)\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This follows by taking the general expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=4m-1$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
16^{m}S_{4m-1}(\pi)+4S_{4m-1}(4\pi) & = & 16^{m}I_{4m-1}(\pi)\\
 & = & -\frac{1}{2}\zeta(4m-1)\left[16^{m}+4\right]\\
 &  & -(2\pi)^{4m-1}\sum_{j=0}^{2m}(-4)^{j}\frac{B_{4m-2j}}{(4m-2j)!}\frac{B_{2j}}{(2j)!}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(4m-1)$
\end_inset

 and then using 
\begin_inset Formula \[
2S_{4m-1}(2\pi)=I_{4m-1}(2\pi)=-\zeta(4m-1)+(2\pi)^{4m-1}\;\sum_{j=0}^{2m}\left(-1\right)^{j}\frac{B_{4m-2j}}{(4m-2j)!}\frac{B_{2j}}{(2j)!}\]

\end_inset

to eliminate the appearance of the zeta.
 The resulting expression may then be solved for 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{4m-1}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relationships involving square roots also arise naturally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
One has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(3)=\frac{5\pi^{3}}{72}-\frac{1}{2}\, S_{3}\left(2\pi\sqrt{3}\right)-\frac{3}{2}\, S_{3}\left(\frac{2\pi\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This follows from the general expression given earlier, that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{k}\left(\frac{2\pi p}{q}\right)+\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^{k-1}S_{k}\left(\frac{2\pi q}{p}\right)=I_{k}\left(\frac{2\pi p}{q}\right)\]

\end_inset

Here, making the substitution 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\sqrt{p}$
\end_inset

 one obtains

Some Bernoulli number identities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the previously noted identity 
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\sum_{j=0}^{2m+1}(-1)^{j}\frac{B_{4m-2j+2}}{(4m-2j+2)!}\frac{B_{2j}}{(2j)!}\]

\end_inset

there are several other identities on sums of Bernoulli numbers that result
 from the previous developments.
 These are briefly stated here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
For integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, one has
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\sum_{j=0}^{m}(-4)^{j}\left[\frac{B_{4m-4j+2}}{(4m-4j+2)!}\frac{B_{4j}}{(4j)!}+2\frac{B_{4m-4j}}{(4m-4j)!}\frac{B_{4j+2}}{(4j+2)!}\right]\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{k=0}^{2m}(-1)^{k}\frac{B_{4m-2k}}{(4m-2k)!}\frac{B_{2k}}{(2k)!} & = & \sum_{j=0}^{m}(-4)^{j}\frac{B_{4m-4j}}{(4m-4j)!}\frac{B_{4j}}{(4j)!}\\
 &  & -2\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}(-4)^{j}\frac{B_{4m-4j-2}}{(4m-4j-2)!}\frac{B_{4j+2}}{(4j+2)!}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Consider the sums resulting from the identity

\begin_layout Section
Modular Relations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The various sums and quantities above can be seen to be quasi-modular by
 making a simple change of variable, namely by making the substitution 
\begin_inset Formula $x=2\pi i\tau$
\end_inset

.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quasi-modular
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it is meant that the various terms almost have simple behaviors under
 the Mobius transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\to(a\tau+b)/(c\tau+d)$
\end_inset

 for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 In this respect, the sums bear close resemblance to theta functions, which
 obey similar relations.
 These relationships are brought to focus here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, define 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{k}(\tau)=I_{k}(2\pi i\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 This change of variable results in a definition which seems simpler than
 that for 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 An expansion in 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is often referred to as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fourier series
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the context of hyperbolic geometry: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
K_{k}(\tau)=\frac{\tau^{k-1}-1}{2}\zeta(k)-\frac{(2\pi i)^{k}}{2\tau}\;\sum_{j=0}^{(k+1)/2}\tau^{2j}\frac{B_{2j}}{(2j)!}\frac{B_{k+1-2j}}{(k+1-2j)!}\]

\end_inset

This quantity is almost a modular form of weight 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

, in that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
K_{k}\left(\frac{-1}{\tau}\right)=-\tau^{1-k}K_{k}(\tau)\]

\end_inset

Its only 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

almost
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a modular form, because it is not periodic in 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, that is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
K_{k}(\tau+1)\ne K_{k}(\tau)\]

\end_inset

By contrast, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{k}(\tau)=S_{k}(2\pi i\tau)$
\end_inset

 is periodic: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
P_{k}(\tau+1)=P_{k}(\tau)\]

\end_inset

but is not quite modular under inversion: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
P_{k}\left(\frac{-1}{\tau}\right)=\tau^{1-k}P_{k}(\tau)+K_{k}\left(\frac{-1}{\tau}\right)\]

\end_inset

One may define a simple variant of the sums that does have a simple transformati
on under inversion, namely 
\begin_inset Formula \[
M_{k}(\tau)=P_{k}(\tau)-\frac{1}{2}K_{k}(\tau)\]

\end_inset

which transforms as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
M_{k}\left(\frac{-1}{\tau}\right)=-\tau^{1-k}M_{k}(\tau)\]

\end_inset

However, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{k}$
\end_inset

 is then not periodic.

 denoting that the sum extends over all divisors

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the sums discussed here are suggestive of linear algebra.
 So for example, one may write the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}$
\end_inset

 as the dot-product between the (infinite-dimensional) vector 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-k}$
\end_inset

 and the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(e^{2\pi n}-1\right)^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 The evaluation of these sums forms a regular pattern in 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, suggesting that, for example, that 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-k}$
\end_inset

 could be taken to be the matrix elements of some linear operator.
 However, the significance of this operator (aside from assorted shallow
 results and relations) is completely unclear.
 The sums over the Bernoulli numbers are even reminiscent of some crazy
 Atiyah-Singer-like indexing; but the underlying operators are utterly unclear.
 Put another way, it is well-known in physics and mathematics that regular
 patterns are the result of symmetries; the sums discussed here form a regular
 pattern, but the nature of the symmetry that generates it is unclear.
 During manipulations, one gets the sense that there are plenty of other
 relations to be discovered; certainly, the mere heft of Ramanujan's tomes
 suggest as much.
 Yet, there is no picture of a generator that can be operated to generate
 the myriad of relations; some symmetry group presentation seems to be missing.
 A similar problem exists in the theory of hypergeometric series, where
 there is an embarrassment of riches in terms of relations and identities,
 and yet a unifying theory is lacking.
 The ingredients to the sums discussed here include the Gamma function and
 the Bernoulli polynomials; among many other properties, these have a common
 set of relations in the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

multiplication theorems
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; the sums here vaguely resemble the multiplication theorems of characteristic
 zero.
 There are also similar phenomena and sums that occur in the theory of dynamical
 systems, and in particular, in symbolic dynamics; there, a group structure,
 or at least, a monoid structure, together with an explicit treatment in
 terms of linear operators, is more common.
 Any of these connections present intriguing avenues for future research;
 however, the overall problem, of discovering the underlying symmetry that
 leads to such relations, seems unattainably hard to solve.

Appendix: Polylog Integral
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This appendix proves the following theorem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
The polylogarithm may be written as the integral 
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\rm Li}_{s}\left(e^{-u}\right)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\Gamma(r)\zeta(r+s)u^{-r}dr\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The proof below is cribbed from the Wikipedia article on polylogarithms
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WP-PL"

\end_inset

.
 One begins by writing the the Mellin transform of the polylog, as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
M_{s}(r)=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm Li}_{s}\left(ye^{-u}\right)u^{r}\frac{du}{u}\]

\end_inset

Using an integral representation of the polylogarithm, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\rm Li}_{s}\left(w\right)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{t^{s-1}}{w^{-1}e^{t}-1}dt\]

\end_inset

 and substituting, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \[
M_{s}(r)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{u^{r-1}t^{s-1}}{y^{-1}e^{t+u}-1}dt\, du\]

\end_inset

A change of variable 
\begin_inset Formula $t=ab$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u=a(1-b)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $dt\, du=a\, da\, db$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
M_{s}(r) & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_{0}^{1}b^{s-1}(1-b)^{r-1}db\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{a^{r+s-1}}{y^{-1}e^{a}-1}\, da\\
 & = & \Gamma(r)\,{\rm Li}_{r+s}(y)\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The inverse Mellin transform may now be employed to write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\rm Li}_{s}\left(ye^{-u}\right)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}u^{-r}\Gamma(r)\,{\rm Li}_{r+s}(y)\, dr\]

\end_inset

By setting 
\begin_inset Formula $y=1$
\end_inset

, one then uses 
\begin_inset Formula ${\rm Li}_{s+r}(1)=\zeta(s+r)$
\end_inset

 to obtain the desired result.
