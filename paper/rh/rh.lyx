Overview

Consider the Bernouli map 
\begin_inset Formula $b(x)=2x-\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor $
\end_inset 

, which is a function of the unit interval onto the unit interval.
 Its transfer operator is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}f\right](x)=\frac{1}{2}\left(f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+f\left(\frac{x+1}{2}\right)\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which maps functions on the unit interval to other functions on the unit
 interval.
 This operator has eigenvectors given by the Hurwitz zeta function, which
 is easily expressed in terms of a closely related function, a variant of
 the polylogarithm:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\beta(x,s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{2\pi inx}}{n^{s}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}\beta\right](x,s)=2^{-s}\beta(x,s)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 That is, every possibly value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 corresponds to an eigenvalue.
 In the above, and in what follows, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 is taken to lie on the unit interval.
 
\layout Standard

There are several remarkable aspects.
 First, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(0,s)=\beta(1,s)=0$
\end_inset 

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is a zero of the Riemann zeta function.
 This seems important somehow.
 For example, if the unit interval were mapped to the real number line,
 e.g.
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $x\to(2x-1)/x(1-x)$
\end_inset 

, then these would be the functions that vanish at infinity (and are presumably
 square-integrable ...
 presumably, need work here).
\layout Standard

The eigenvectors are countably degenerate, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{\prime}=s+2\pi in/\ln2$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset 

.
 Not sure, but I beleive no two zeros on the critical line correspond to
 degenerate eigenvalues; this would need proof.
\layout Standard

Next curiosity: the Bernoulli operator can be interpreted as a one-sided
 shift operator on a one-dimensional lattice.
