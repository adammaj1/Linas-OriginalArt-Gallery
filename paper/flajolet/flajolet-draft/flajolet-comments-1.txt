Phillipe,
Comments and corrections to the text.

Aside from various corrections, a general remark: I noticed that 
parts of the text are laid out in historical order, as if this 
were a diary recording the events leading up to the discovery.
I don't see a need for this; its more direct to assume that
we already know the result obtained at the end, and we need 
to merely explain how it may be derived.

Specific comments:

Page 1:
  After equation (2), we should state equation (32), so as to
  emphasize that not only do we show that b_n are exponentially
  small, but also that we have an explcit expression for them.

  We should also summarize any other noteworthy results, rather
  than requiring the reader to excavate them from somewhere 
  deep in the paper.  (The interested reader may then dig
  to find out *how* to obtain such results).

Page 2:
  "[Unpublished, see http://linas.org]"

  I would like to convert this reference at least into something 
  that is available via arxiv.org.  However, deposition a document
  there requires the approval of two reviewers. Do you have this
  type of review permission?

Page 2, end of introduction.
  We should write a one sentance description of each section, 
  and what each section accomplishes.


Page 3 after equation 9:
 "It is surprising that such a simple sum should exhibit the complicated
  asymptotic behaviour described by Theorem 1 below."

 replace by

 "This rather simple sum shows a remarkably complex behaviour;
  elucidating this behaviour is one of the principle topics of this
  paper."

Section 3, general comments:
 This section sometimes pretends that we don't know what the 
 results of the later sections will be. There is no need to do
 this; we do do know the asymptotic behaviiour, and should focus
 on the differences from the asymptotic behaviour.

Same page:
 "A good fit for the k'th zero is provided by..."

  We know this formula, or could infer it from the asymptotic
  behaviour we find later. Thus, I think its more interesting 
  to push it farther, away from the asymptotic region, and 
  give the more precise numeric estimate I gave in the earlier 
  draft.
 
 "The quadratic polynomial is easily inverted to give the 
  approximate oscillatory behaviour of the b_n:"

  In fact, the fit is remarkably poor. For some reason, it is 
  much worse than the fit for the other quantity I was looking 
  at last year. I don't nderstand why.  For this reason, I want 
  to replace the formula for s(n) with one that goes out to a
  higher order in n. I don;'t ave this formula yet, so this 
  comment is pending ... 


Next sentance:
  "... a more precise fit is strangely difficult."

  Omit he word "strangely.".

  Again, this is pretending we don't know what the value of K is.
  However, we do know the value of K. Similarly, in the next 
  paragraph: 

  "...presence of an extra factor of n^\kappa for some \kappa \in (0,1)"

  We know what \kappa is, its 1/4. If numeric results are presented,
  they should be presented with two objectives:
  1) confirm that they are in full agreement with the asymptotic 
     behaviour we know from the analytic work, 
  2) provide the next level of detail for the parts that we 
     honestly do not know about.


Section 4, bottom of page 5:
   "It is well nown that the Rieman zeta function is of finite order
   in any right half-plane..."

   This begs the question "What is A?" We should simple state 
   "the right hand half-plane" and give the value for A, and then,
   say "the left hand half-plane" and give te value there. 

Page 6, sentance before eqn 14:
  "...for the difference between \delta_n and b_n (see (2)):"

  replace with:

  "...for the difference between \delta_n and b_n, so that:"

After equation 14:

  "At this stage, the change of variable..."

  This statement lacks motivation. We should explain that there
  are no poles on the left, and that there are saddles, and
  that we'll be doing a saddle-point evaluation, and that 
  it will be more convenient to put everything in the right hand
  half-plane to do this analysis. THAT is the true reason for the 
  change of variable. 

Section 5, just after equation 17:
  Again, use our fore-knowledge to motivate. We know that the 
  saddle points will be at (1+i) sqrt(n). Say this now; don't 
  leave the reader guessing and in suspense. If the reader 
  knows what answer to expect, they'll be better able to 
  follow the steps to get there.

  (In general, each section should start with a summary of 
  what we hope to accomplish, and finish with a summary of
  what we accomplished. In this case, this section will 
  do a steepest descent evaluation at the point (1+i)sqrt(n))

Equation 18:
   "... Re(s) > 3/2"

  shouldn't that be 

  "...Re(s) > 1"  ?? I don't understand the 3/2... 


Page 7 top of page:

  "The scaling regime..."

  Back when you wrote your first letter to me, I found this 
  confusing. I kept trying to write asymptotic expansions for
  large s and large n at the same time, and this kept not working.
  It took a while for me to understand that the correct thing
  to do was to make a change of variable to x=s/sqrt(n), and 
  then make te assumption that the location of the saddle point
  is approximately independent of x. 

  I think that it is worth explaining this in greater detail.
  In particular, if we've already told the reader that the
  saddle point was at s=(1+i)sqrt(n), it now becomes easy 
  to argue that one *must* make the change of variable x=s/sqrt(n)
  *before* starting he asymptotitic expansion in n.

Page 7, middle of page:

  "This back-of-the-envelope ... with the empirically obtained formula."

  Modify this sentance. Again, the goal is not to present the 
  results in historical order. The empirical section should have
  already mentioned that its in agreement with this analysis.

Page 8, contour plot

  The contour plot should extend farther in the +/- imaginary
  directions, and also in the negative direction, to highlight 
  the saddle points.

  Throughly remarkably, this plot shows lots of tiny saddle
  points that we haven't seen/noticed/discussed before:
  these are the saddles between the zeros on the real axis.
  We need pick only one, but I presume it will make a 
  non-trivial contribution. I'll try to calculate this tonight.

I stopped reading here; so only a few scatered comments:

Equations (55) ff:
  I'll provide corrections as soon as possible.

Abstract:
  "The finite differences of qunatities involving values of the zeta
   functions at the ..."

  replace by the more direct, immediate

  "The finite differences of the Rieman zeta function at the..."

Page 2, after equation (3)
 "... imply that te candidate sequence (c_n) is ..."

  I notice that here, and elsewhere, the sequences sometimes are 
  surrounded by parenthesis, and sometimes not. I don't feel an 
  urgent need to distinguish the sequence (c_n) from its individual
  elements c_n. This paper does not rely on any results that require
  such a distinction, thus I suggest dropping parenthesis here, and
  elsewhere.
 
  So: same sentance, 
  "...related to the sequence (\phi(m))..."

  Page 3, just after equation (9):
  "The ordinary genreating function of (\delta(n))..."

  After equation (10):
  "The exponential generating function of (\delta_n)..."

  page 4:
  "There are sign changes of (b_n)..."

Page 2, bottom of page:
  "The validity of \Phi(s)=\phi(s) is often found to extend..."

  replace by

  "The equivalence of \Phi(s)=\phi(s) is often found to extend..."

Same sentance, 
  "...but this fact requires specific properties much beyond the mere
  convergence of the series in (3)."

  replace by 
  
  "...but this fact requires additional properties beyond the mere
  convergence of the series in (3)."

  Also, this sentance begs a question: "and what are those properties?"
  I suggest answering this question in one or two sentances. Suggest
  replacing his sentance with something like:

  "The equivalence of \Phi(m)=\phi(m) can be extended to a region 
  of the complex plane containing the integers, provided that the
  growth of the difference \Phi(s)-\phi(s) is bounded in the imaginary
  direction. This result is known as Carlson's theorem, and is 
  presented in a more precise form later in this paper."

Page 3, after equation 8:
  "..differences to zeta values at the integer."

  "integer" needs an "s" at the end.

Next sentance:
 "Indeed, defining as usual \Delta..."

 replace by

 "Defining the forward difference \Delta ..."

Section 3, second paragraph, first sentance:
  "... they are oscillatory and thier absolute value..."

  replace by

  "... they are oscillatory with slowly increasing period 
  and thier absolute value..."

Page 5, top:

  "A plot of the values of log|b_n/s_n| ..."

  Elsewhere, the notation s(n) is used, not s_n. Should be 
  consistent.
 
Page 6, top of page:
   "...taking into account the residues at the poles s=1 and s=0."

   replace by

  "...taking into account the residues of a double pole at s=1
   and a simple pole at s=0."

Page 7, before equation 26:
  "... from crude majorizations,..."

  should be

  "...from crude approximations, ..."

Page 7, after equation 26:

  "The scale of the problem there is dictated.."

  Elide "there".

Equation (32): 
  Please write 

  "b_n = (8n/pi)^{1/4}" instead of 2^{3/4} pi^{1/4} ... n^{1/4}

Equation (34):
  s and n are reversed.
