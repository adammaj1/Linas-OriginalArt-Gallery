\layout Title

Generalizations
\layout Standard

Philippe,
\layout Standard

I worked through the last part of the paper in greater detail, and have
 come to the conclusion that the theorem is faulty.
 I started by attempting to generalize the proof to other series, in particular
 the Liouville and the Euler totient series.
 All of these have in common that they have 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s)$
\end_inset 

 in the denominator, implying poles on the critical line.
 The asymptotic behaviour of the finite differences for each is quite different
 -- and this is what leads me to conclude that we cannot deduce the location
 of the poles based on the asymptotic behaviour, or that, at least, the
 part of the proof that attempts to do this is not correct.
\layout Standard

Anyway, here's what follows (its quite long): a review of the definition
 of the series.
 A numeric exploration of the series (a rather surprising/interesting behaviour
 is seen for the Mobius series!).
 A saddle-point analysis to obtain asymptotic behaviour.
 The saddle point analysis appears to be consistent with the numeric work.
 An attempted generalization of the proof, which I'm unable to complete.
\layout Standard

I wrote most of the below before I realized that I couldn't make the RH
 equivalence proof work, so there may be some inconsistent comments below.

Review of Dirichlet Series
\layout Standard

Much of the proof depends on having 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s)$
\end_inset 

 in the denominator, and there are many Dirichlet series that achieve this.
 The canonical one, involving the Mobius function is
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\mu(n)}{n^{s}}=\frac{1}{\zeta(s)}\]

\end_inset 

 But there is also one for the Euler Phi function:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\phi(n)}{n^{s}}=\frac{\zeta(s-1)}{\zeta(s)}\]

\end_inset 

 The Liouville function:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\lambda(n)}{n^{s}}=\frac{\zeta(2s)}{\zeta(s)}\]

\end_inset 

 The von Mangoldt function 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^{s}}=-\frac{\zeta^{\prime}(s)}{\zeta(s)}\]

\end_inset 

 There are a dozen others that can be readily found in introductory textbooks
 and/or the web.
 
\layout Standard

One may construct in a very straightforward way the Dirichlet series for
 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\zeta(s-a)$
\end_inset 

 for any complex 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset 

, as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\zeta(2s-a)$
\end_inset 

.
 These can be constructed by a fairly trivial application of Dirichlet convoluti
on, together with the Mobius inversion formula.
 In short, one has an old, general theorem that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(f*g)(n)}{n^{s}}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{f(n)}{n^{s}}\;\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{g(m)}{m^{s}}\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $f*g$
\end_inset 

 is the Dirichlet convolution of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
(f*g)(n)=\sum_{d|n}f(d)g\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Since Dirichlet convolution is invertible whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $f(1)\ne1$
\end_inset 

 (and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $g(1)\ne1$
\end_inset 

), one may multiply and divide Dirichlet series with impunity, more or less.
 
\layout Standard

I haven't yet seen a way of building 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\zeta(\alpha s+\beta)$
\end_inset 

, or more complicated expressions.
\layout Standard

As regards to the proof, perhaps the most important generalization is that
 for the Dirichlet 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset 

-functions, since these are the ones for which the GRH applies.
 Specifically, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\mu(n)\chi(n)}{n^{s}}=\frac{1}{L(s,\chi)}\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset 

 is the Dirichlet character.
 
\layout Section*

Numeric Exploration
\layout Standard

This section provides a numeric exploration of the finite differences of
 the various Dirichlet series given above.
 Consider first
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}=\sum_{k=2}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left({n\atop k}\right)\,\frac{1}{\zeta(k)}\]

\end_inset 

 By examining 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset 

 in the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\le n\le1000$
\end_inset 

, one would be tempted to incorrectly conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty}d_{n}=2$
\end_inset 

; this behaviour is shown in the graph below.
 However, by exploring the range 
\begin_inset Formula $1000\le n\le50000$
\end_inset 

, one discovers that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset 

 is oscillatory.
 The oscillations seem bounded, and thus the numeric work suggests that
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}=\mathcal{O}\left(\log n\right)\]

\end_inset 

 or possibly better, but presumably not 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(1)$
\end_inset 

.

\begin_inset Formula $2\le n\le60$
\end_inset 

.
 It strongly suggests an asymptotic approach to 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}\to2$
\end_inset 

, which can be seen to be incorrect if larger 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 are explored.

 As with the previous graphic, it strongly but incorrectly suggests that
 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}\to2$
\end_inset 

in the limit of large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

.
 That this is not the case can be discovered by pursuing larger 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

.

\begin_inset Formula $500\le n\le30000$
\end_inset 

.
 Rather than approaching a limit for large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, there are a series of oscillations that seem to grow ever larger.
 The amplitude of these oscillations appears to be of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{2}\right)$
\end_inset 

 or possibly 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{2}\log n\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 In either case, such oscillations indicate that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset 

cannot be approaching a constant for large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, instead suggesting that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset 

 is itself oscillatory for large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, as the next graphic shows.

 A nascent oscillatory behaviour can be seen.
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The finite differences for the other series appear to show a similar pattern,
 except that the scale of the leading order is different.
 Consider, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}^{\varphi}=\sum_{k=3}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left({n\atop k}\right)\,\frac{\zeta(k-1)}{\zeta(k)}\]

\end_inset 

 with the superscript 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset 

 indicating that the corresponding Dirichlet series involves the totient
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset 

.
 For smaller values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, numeric analysis suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}^{\varphi}=\mathcal{O}\left(n^{2}\log n\right)$
\end_inset 

, as the following graphics illustrate.

\layout Section*

Saddle-point analysis
\layout Standard

The asymptotic behaviour of the 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset 

 can be obtained by performing a saddle-point evaluation of the corresponding
 Norlund-Rice integral.
 That is, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}=\frac{(-1)^{n}}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}f(s)\frac{n!}{s(s-1)(s-2)\cdots(s-n)}ds\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(s)=1/\zeta(s)$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}^{\mu}$
\end_inset 

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(s)=\zeta(s-1)/\zeta(s)$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}^{\varphi}$
\end_inset 

, and so on.
 By assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, it has been shown that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(s)=\mathcal{O}\left(\left|t\right|^{\epsilon}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{\zeta(s)}=\mathcal{O}\left(\left|t\right|^{\epsilon}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\sigma+it$
\end_inset 

, as 
\begin_inset Formula $t\to\infty$
\end_inset 

.
 This can be substituted directly into the integral.
 One should also take account of the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\zeta(s)$
\end_inset 

 has a zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset 

 that cancels one of the poles in the integrand.
 Thus, one obtains, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
d_{n}^{\mu} & = & \mathcal{O}(1)\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\frac{\left|s\right|^{\epsilon}}{s}\,\frac{n!}{(s-2)(s-3)\cdots(s-n)}ds\\
 & = & \mathcal{O}(1)\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}e^{N\omega(s)}ds\\
 & = & \mathcal{O}(1)\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{N\omega^{\prime\prime}\left(s_{0}\right)}}e^{N\omega\left(s_{0}\right)}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}$
\end_inset 

 the saddle point.
 Careful analysis shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $N=\log n$
\end_inset 

, so that the saddle-point approximation is valid, and that the saddle point
 is located at
\begin_inset Formula \[
s_{0}=\frac{1-\epsilon}{\log n}\left[1+\frac{1-\gamma}{\log n}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\log^{2}n}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset 

 This saddle point is located very near the origin; one must take the integratio
n contour so that it passes from the lower-right quadrant, crosses 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=1/2$
\end_inset 

 to approach the origin, and departs to the upper-right quadrant.
 
\layout Standard

The two parts of the saddle point formula are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e^{N\omega(s_{0})}=\left(\frac{e\log n}{1-\epsilon}\right)^{1-\epsilon}+\mathcal{O}(1)\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{N\omega^{\prime\prime}\left(s_{0}\right)}}=\frac{\sqrt{2\pi\left(1-\epsilon\right)}}{\log n}\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\log n}\right)\right)\]

\end_inset 

Combining these, one obtains
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}^{\mu}=\mathcal{O}(1)\cdot\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{1-\epsilon}}\left(1+\epsilon\log\left(\frac{1-\epsilon}{\log n}\right)\right)\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\log n}\right)\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Pulling all of these factors together, one concludes that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}^{\mu}=\mathcal{O}\left(\log\log n\right)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Subsection*

An alternate analysis
\layout Standard

There is an alternate approach to the analysis which leads to some curious
 observations about the relationship between the Riemann Hypothesis and
 the location of saddle points.
 One may take as the starting point the well known formula 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(s)=\frac{\exp\left(\log2\pi-1-\gamma/2\right)s}{2\left(s-1\right)\Gamma\left(1+s/2\right)}\prod_{\rho}\left(1-\frac{s}{\rho}\right)e^{s/\rho}\]

\end_inset 

 Here, the product extends over the zeros 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset 

 of the Riemann zeta function.
 The derivation of this formula does not require the assumption of the RH,
 and so this seems to provide a more general starting point for a saddle-point
 analysis.
 To proceed, one must 
\emph on 
assume
\emph default 
 that the only saddle point is located near the origin.
 As will be made clear later, this assumption is equivalent to assuming
 RH.
 
\layout Standard

Making this assumption that the only saddle point is near the origin, one
 then obtains for its location 
\begin_inset Formula \[
s_{0}=\frac{1}{\log n}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\log^{2}n}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 The only direct requirement on the location of the zeros was that they
 satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{\rho}\frac{1}{\rho\left(\rho-s\right)}=\mathcal{O}\left(1\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Proceeding with the saddle-point analysis, one obtains that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}=\mathcal{O}\left(1\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Note that this result seems to be obtainable with only extremely weak assumptio
ns about the location of the zeros of the Riemann zeta.
 This makes sense: the saddle point is essentially a local property, and
 local properties shouldn't really depend on the fine points of distant
 parts of the integrand.
 Thus, it is tempting to conclude that the result that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}=\mathcal{O}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset 

 follows without requiring RH; but this would be wrong.
 This result was based on the assumption that the only saddle point was
 near the origin, and this assumption must surely require RH, as will be
 established in a later section.
\layout Subsection*

Saddle-point analysis for the Totient series
\layout Standard

This section summarizes a saddle-point analysis for the totient function
 finite difference series 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}^{\varphi}=\sum_{k=3}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left({{n\atop k}}\right)\,\frac{\zeta(k-1)}{\zeta(k)}\]

\end_inset 

 The integrand of the corresponding Norlund-Rice integral is regular at
 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset 

 and has a simple pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset 

, and a double pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=2$
\end_inset 

.
 In most other respects, it resembles the previous integral.
 It can be seen to have a saddle point near 
\begin_inset Formula $s=2$
\end_inset 

 which determines the asymptotic behaviour.
 Evaluating the integrand for the location of the saddle point, one obtains
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
s_{0}=2+\frac{2}{\log n}+\frac{(1-\epsilon)/2-\gamma}{\log^{2}n}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\log^{3}n}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 The two parts of the formula are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e^{N\omega(s_{0})}=\mathcal{O}(1)\cdot n^{2}\log^{2}n\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
N\omega^{\prime\prime}\left(s_{0}\right)=-2\log^{2}n+\frac{1-\epsilon}{4}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\log n}\right)\]

\end_inset 

Combining these, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}^{\varphi}=\mathcal{O}\left(n^{2}\log n\right)\]

\end_inset 

 This result is in good agreement with the numerical calculations for the
 range 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{2}<n<10^{4}$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Subsection*

Saddle-point analysis for the Liouville series
\layout Standard

This section summarizes a saddle-point analysis for the Liouville function
 finite difference series 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}^{\lambda}=\sum_{k=2}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left({{n\atop k}}\right)\,\frac{\zeta(2k)}{\zeta(k)}\]

\end_inset 

 The integrand of the corresponding Norlund-Rice integral is regular at
 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset 

 and has a simple pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $2s=1$
\end_inset 

.
 In all other respects, it resembles the previous integrals.
 Thus, a priori we expect a saddle point near 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1/2$
\end_inset 

 to determine the asymptotic behaviour.
 Indeed, proceeding as before, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \[
s_{0}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2+\epsilon/4}{\log n}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\log^{2}n}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 The two parts of the saddle-point formula may be obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e^{N\omega(s_{0})}=\mathcal{O}(1)\cdot\sqrt{n}\,\frac{\log n}{2+\epsilon/4}\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
N\omega^{\prime\prime}\left(s_{0}\right)=\frac{1-\epsilon/4}{2}\,\log^{2}n+\mathcal{O}(1)\]

\end_inset 

 which may be combined to obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}^{\lambda}=\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{n}\right)\]

\end_inset 

This result is in good agreement with the numerical calculations for the
 range 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{2}<n<10^{4}$
\end_inset 

.

Equivalence to the Riemann Hypothesis
\layout Standard

Based on the above, I'm concluding that the theorem regarding the equivalence
 to the RH is faulty.
 The Dirichlet series for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset 

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

 all have poles on the critical line.
 The general arguments for the asymptotic form of the 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}^{\mu}$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}^{\phi}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset 

, etc.
 are the same, but the actual form of the asymptotic behaviour is quite
 different.
 I don't see how this behaviour can be turned around to deduce the location
 of the poles.
 Before I realized this, I wrote the section below, attempting to generalize
 the proof; apparently it went astray, and I was unable to proceed.
\layout Subsection

Generalization of the proof
\layout Standard

Based on the above, I suggest modifying the proof so that, in one direction,
 it runs as follows
\layout Standard

Consider the general Dirichlet series 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{n^{s}}\]

\end_inset 

 for some arithmetic function 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}=\mu(n)$
\end_inset 

.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}=\sum_{k=2}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left({n\atop k}\right)\, f(k)\]

\end_inset 

 one finds immediately that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}=\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}a_{m}\left[\left(1-\frac{1}{m}\right)^{n}-1+\frac{n}{m}\right]\]

\end_inset 

 The leading order of a term in this sum is 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{m}n^{2}/m^{2}$
\end_inset 

 and so convergence is guaranteed for 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{m}=\mathcal{O}\left(m^{1-\epsilon}\right)$
\end_inset 

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset 

.
 This condition is satisfied by both the Mobius and the Liouville sums,
 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $|\mu(m)|\le1$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $|\lambda(m)|\le1$
\end_inset 

.
 The analogous sum for the totient function starts at k=3, and thus has
 the form

More generally, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Ramanujan conjecture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 states that any series obeying RH will satisfy a similar bound; this is
 discussed further below.
\layout Standard

Define 
\begin_inset Formula \[
D(x)=\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}a_{m}\left[e^{-x/m}-1+\frac{x}{m}\right]\]

\end_inset 

 which has similar convergence properties to the previous sum.
 The estimate for the behaviour of this sum proceeds essentially unmodified,
 although I present some additional detail here to make this clear.
 
\layout Standard

The aim is to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D(x)$
\end_inset 

 are substantially similar, and that in particular, both quantities have
 the same asymptotic behaviour for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset 

 (that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $x\to\infty$
\end_inset 

).
 This will be done by comparing the two directly.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}=n^{1-\delta}$
\end_inset 

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset 

 small but fixed.
 Write
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}-D(n)=\sum_{m<m_{0}}+\sum_{m\ge m_{0}}a_{m}e^{-n/m}\left[e^{n/m+n\log(1-1/m)}-1\right]\]

\end_inset 

 For large 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset 

, namely, those appearing in the second sum, one easily finds 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e^{n/m+n\log(1-1/m)}-1=\mathcal{O}\left(n/m^{2}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $m\to\infty$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 held fixed.
 From this, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{m\ge m_{0}}a_{m}e^{-n/m}\left[e^{n/m+n\log(1-1/m)}-1\right] & = & \mathcal{O}\left(n\right)\sum_{m\ge m_{0}}\frac{a_{m}}{m^{2}}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n^{2-3\delta}}\right)\\
 & = & \mathcal{O}\left(n^{\delta}\right)\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset 

.
 This result requires no additional constraints on the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{m}$
\end_inset 

 other than the weak condition already given.
 
\layout Standard

For the other sum, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{m<m_{0}}a_{m}e^{-n/m}\left[e^{n/m+n\log(1-1/m)}-1\right] & = & \mathcal{O}\left(1\right)\sum_{m<m_{0}}a_{m}e^{-n/m}\\
 & = & \mathcal{O}\left(e^{-n/m_{0}}\right)\sum_{m<m_{0}}a_{m}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 The remaining sum is at most quadratic in 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}$
\end_inset 

, and is dominated by the exponential term 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-n/m_{0}}=e^{-n^{\delta}}$
\end_inset 

.
 For fixed positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset 

, this term decreases exponentially.
 Thus one concludes that
\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}-D(n)=\mathcal{O}\left(n^{\delta}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Again, this result requires no particularly special assumptions.
\layout Standard

To show that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D(x)$
\end_inset 

 have an identical asymptotic behaviour for non-integer real 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

, one may consider the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\prime}(x)$
\end_inset 

 and show that it is suitably bounded.
 Proceeding along the same lines as before, and starting with 
\begin_inset Formula \[
D^{\prime}(x)=-\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_{m}}{m}\left[e^{-x/m}-1\right]\]

\end_inset 

one deduces that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
D^{\prime}(x)=\mathcal{O}\left(n^{\delta}\right)+\mathcal{O}(1)\sum_{m<m_{0}}\frac{a_{m}}{m}\]

\end_inset 

 At this point I notice an error in my notes, and, as it is late at night,
 I'd rather not guess my way out of it.
 I don't believe its serious.
 The remainder of the proof, regarding the Mellin transform goes through
 unmodified.

The only fact about Selberg class functions used in this proof seems to
 be the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Ramanujan conjecture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, namely, a necessary condition for RH to hold is that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}=\mathcal{O}\left(n^{r+\epsilon}\right)$
\end_inset 

 for some real 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 and any 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset 

.
 In the above, it was required that 
\begin_inset Formula $r<2$
\end_inset 

, but other 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

's are easily accommodated.
 Simply changing the definition to

\begin_inset Formula \[
d_{n}=\sum_{k=n_{0}}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left({n\atop k}\right)\, f(k)\]

\end_inset 

 allows for any 
\begin_inset Formula $r<n_{0}$
\end_inset

Just as you have shown the so-called

Riesz means

 defined by Hardy & Littlewood in the paper you sent me, with the so-called

\end_inset 

Perron's formula
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 expressing a finite sum as a Mellin transform.
 There appear to be various bounds on finite sums that are known to number
 theory, and I am hoping that by means of Perron's formula, these can be
 converted over to the asymptotic behaviour of the Norlund-Rice integral
 that we desire.
 Maybe.
 But this is only after mulling things over while walking the dog, it might
 not work.

On further review of the Selberg class, it defines a lot of ingredients
 that seem to be necessary in order for GRH to hold.
 So far, we've used only one of these.
 Perhaps the others come into play in this half of the proof, which might
 suggest that this half of the proof is much harder?

Its not clear how Li's criterion impacts on the Selberg class, and vice-versa.
 It may be an edifying exercise to connect the two together.
 Alternately, I'd like to translate Li's criterion to this proof, but don't
 quite see how.
