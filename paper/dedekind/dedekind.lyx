\layout Abstract

An exploration of the interior or the Mandelbrot Set and its relationship
 to the Dedekind eta function.
 This provides yet another example of the close interconnection between
 the structure of the Modular Group and fractals.
\layout Abstract

This paper is part of a set of chapters that explore the relationship between
 the real numbers, the modular group, and fractals.

Dedekind Eta and the Mandelbrot Set
\layout Standard

Consider the Euler function 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\phi(q)=\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{k})\]

\end_inset 

 on the complex plane.
 It is closely related to the Dedekind eta function.
 The accompanying figure shows 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(q)$
\end_inset 

 inside the unit circle 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|<1$
\end_inset 

.

Regulated Series 
\layout Standard

Consider the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},...\}$
\end_inset 

.
 Then for small positive 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset 

, construct the sum 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S(t)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}e^{-tn}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 In the following,we'll refer to this as the 
\emph on 
regulated series for the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ a_{n}\}$
\end_inset 


\emph default 
.
 For large class of reasonably behaved series 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ a_{n}\}$
\end_inset 

, this sum is finite for all positive values of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset 

.
 By 'reasonably behaved' we mean a sequence where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 doesn't get exponentially large with increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

; that is, one where the sum converges.
 
\layout Standard

This sum participates in some interesting number-theoretic relationships
 when the 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ a_{n}\}$
\end_inset 

 are considered to be the spectrum of an operator.
 In the following, we will be considering the 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ a_{n}\}$
\end_inset 

 not as a spectrum, but instead as the iterates of the Mandelbrot Set.
 Before doing so, lets quickly review some basic properties.
\layout Standard

One can define a Dirichlet series 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
C(s)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{n^{s}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which can be easily converted into the first sum with an integral transform.
 
\layout Standard

The spectral analysis consists of exploring the behavior of the sum in the
 limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow0$
\end_inset 

.
 Depending on the series, it may diverge.
 For example, if we take all 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 to be one, the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $N(t)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\exp(-tn)$
\end_inset 

 diverges as 1/t, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}n\,\exp(-tn)$
\end_inset 

 diverges as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/t^{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 The corresponding Dirichlet series exhibt poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s=2$
\end_inset 

, respectively, for these sums.
 The core idea behind spectral analysis is that in general, one can gain
 insight into the structure of the series 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ a_{n}\}$
\end_inset 

by understanding the analytic structure of the related series.
 In other words, instead of studying 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ a_{n}\}$
\end_inset 

 directly, we study the expansion 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S(t)=\sum_{n=-N}^{\infty}s_{n}t^{n}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 instead.
 
\layout Standard

When engaging in numerical calculations,the Dirichlet series is nearly numerical
ly intractable, because of its painfully slow convergence.
 Thus,one is instantly motivated to use the exponential series instead.
 However, one gets an even more stable and numerically well-behaved series
 by considering the Gaussian regulator, namely 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}\exp(-t^{2}n^{2})\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 There is no harm in using this series for numerical work; it can be related
 back to the Dierichlet series through analytic integral transforms, albeit
 somehwat more complex ones than the plain exponential series.
\layout Subsection

The Mandelbrot Set
\layout Standard

Now consider the standard Mandelbrot set iteration 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
z_{n+1}=z_{n}^{2}+c\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 ant the regulated series for this sequence of points 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S_{c}(t)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z_{n}e^{-t^{2}n^{2}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where we've added the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset 

 to remind us that this series takes on distinct values for every point
 
\begin_inset Formula $c\in\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset 

.
 For most of the interior of the Mandelbrot set, this sum diverges as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/t$
\end_inset 

.
 To normalize this sum, let us define 
\begin_inset Formula \[
N(t)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}e^{-t^{2}n^{2}}\]

\end_inset 

 which also diverges as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/t$
\end_inset 

.
 The next image shows the nature of the divergence by normalizing against
 this value.

Plot of the divergent term of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{c}(t)$
\end_inset 

.
 The figure shows 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{t->0^{+}}|S_{c}(t)|/N(t)$
\end_inset 

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $|x|$
\end_inset 

 is the ordinary complex modulus.
 Black represents a value of zero, and green a value of 1/2.
 Points outside of the M-set are explicitly excluded from this picture.
 An explicit expression for this divergent term is given in the text.
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

To render an image of this, let N(t) = Sumn=0inf exp (-t2n2) which also
 diverges as 1/t.
 We use this to show the divergence: the image below shows limt->0 |S(t)|/N(t)
 where |S(t)| is just the modulus of S(t); that is, |S(t)| = sqrt ((Re S(t))2
 + (Im S(t))2)
