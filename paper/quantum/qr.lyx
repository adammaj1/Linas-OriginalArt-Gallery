\begin_layout Title
The Origins of Quantum Mechanics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
An attempt to do physics, instead of math.
 No formulas, just some postulates of things that seem like they are true
 or should be true.
 Just random disorganized thoughts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Intro
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, this is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with gravitation.
 Its primarily a discussion of principles that seem like they should guide
 such a unification.
 This means few or no equations.
 Some of these principles may be controversial, and surely some readers
 will think they're wrong.
 They might be, but its the groundwork.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This also begins by (almost) completely ignoring the work of others on quantum
 gravity and strings and 'tHooft and so-on.
 I want to state what seem to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

first principles
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, whereas these existing theories have already made explicit or implicit
 assumptions about first principles that are in contradiction with what
 I'm pondering.
 This does not mean that these alternative theories are wrong; but rather,
 if we start with them, the conflicting principles results in trouble.
 Thus, I'm trying to start with a clean slate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Principle: Quantum post facto
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of quantum mechanics should come out of the unification of QM
 and gravity, rather than being one of the ingredients going into it.
 In particular, the Feynmann functional integral should be something that
 comes out of the theory, as an unavoidable result, rather than going into
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Principle: Quantum is primarily microscopic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a rejection of the Schroedinger-Cat paradox.
 I'm not sure, it may be equivalent to a rejection of Many-Worlds.
 Its a statement about wave-funcion collapse.
 The idea is that any quantum effect (e.g.
 quantum measurement) that causes sufficiently large perturbations in its
 surroundings causes a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave-function collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The cut-off point seems to be the Planck mass.
 That is, when the decaying nucleus that kills the cat fires off, it is
 in a superposition, but only to the point that about one Planck-mass of
 detector atoms are involved.
 After that, alternative histories either converge or spontaneously evaporate.
 So, for example, althugh there are and continue to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

many worlds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the quantum scale, once some of these interact with the macroscopic
 scale, the probabilies of the alternative worlds shrink exponentially to
 zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The argument is that gravitation is too weak to have any significant effect
 on the microscopic scale, and the fact that an electron might be in many
 places at once has vanishing gravitational effect, up to the point that
 the electron has disturbed about 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{18}$
\end_inset

 atoms, at which point, gravitational effects can no longer be ignored.
 That is, gravitation remains classical, and there is a single unique spacetime
 geometry at the macroscopic scale.
 Put another way: if Schroedingers cat is alive, spacetime curves one way,
 and if the cat is dead, then spacetime curves another way.
 There is no superposition of different spacetime curvatures.
 There are not many-worlds of parallel spacetimes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Principle: Spacetime is emergent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is kind of a reversal of Verlinde's ideas.
 The concept of Lorentz invariance isn't possible, until one is working
 at a scale where spacetime exists.
 The core issue here is that all of our clocks and rulers are microscopic
 and quantum mecchanical: we measure time by vibrations of some quantum
 dvice.
 We measure space by counting wavelengths.
 The proposed reefinition of mass in the SI system will also be quantum
 based.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Principle: there are no electrically charged bosons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, there are: W+/-, but that's beside the point, the point being that
 eletrons have spin half and that the spin is the ultimate source for the
 quantum effects, when coupled to the electric field.
 Viz spin is a twisting up of space.
 Rather than treating spin as a representation of the rotational symmetry
 of space, we should treat spin as a certain tangling up of multiple paths
 (e.g.
 paths in the sense of functional integral, or in the sense of Hamilton-Jacobi
 variational principle) so that we should envision these paths as a kind-of-like
 Hopf fibration -- the paths are the fibers, the resulting fibration is
 an object that belongs to the 2 representation of SU(2).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is, we treat quantum paths as if they were fibers, and then ask: how
 can we tangle them up, so that the grand-total holonomy behaves as if it
 were a spin-1/2 object? I suspect that such a tangling is impossible, without
 also pairing the object with a second one, i.e.
 in the sense of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum entanglement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does eletric charge have to do with this? The idea here is that the
 electric charge at large distances looks like central-force attractive/repulsiv
e, and so one can ask about the geodesics of the free-falling electrically-charg
ed observer.
 The free-falling observer does fine, until he gets within a compton-length
 of the electron, in which case there's a fibration of multiple paths that
 become possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is, the point-like nature of the observer/geodesic becomes replaced
 by a spray(??) so that instead of saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a single thing is in multiple locations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (as is normaly done in QM), we should instead say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there are multiple locations associated with a single thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (which seems to be the same sentence, but is not): i.e.
 that spacetime no longer has a simple structure at the microscopic level.
 The concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

location
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 becomes flawed in some certain way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Other stuff

\begin_layout Standard
Unsorted ideas: mass is an emergent property as well....

\begin_layout Paragraph
Second Law of Thermodynamics

 says that entropy is increasing, and Boltzmanns constant says entropy is
 mass but this is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upside down
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from hawking radiation/entropy.
 So, there seem to be conflicting ideas: the mass of thermodynamic systems
 goes up in proportion to the heat energy (see Planck, Max (1907), "Zur
 Dynamik bewegter Systeme", Sitzungsberichte der Königlich-Preussischen
 Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin, Erster Halbband (29): 542–570 English
 Wikisource translation: On the Dynamics of Moving Systems) ...
 so if you melt ice, the mass of the melt-water is greater than that of
 the original ice.
 Relatedly, there's a mass loss from binding energy.
 However, the relation of binding energy to entropy is opaque: when a system
 is bound, did the number of accessible states decrease? It would seem so:
 the ionized state is not accessible to the system.
 However, one does not normally associate an entropy with a QM system, but
 the goal is to argue that the entropy of hydrogen is less than that of
 ionized hydrogen.
