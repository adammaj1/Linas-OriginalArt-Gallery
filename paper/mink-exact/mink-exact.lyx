\begin_layout Abstract
The Minkowski Question Mark function relates the continued-fraction representati
on of the real numbers, to their binary expansion.
 Although it is difficult to reason about its derivative, one can show by
 classical techniques that its derivative must vanish on all rationals.
 Since the Question Mark itself is continuous, one concludes that the derivative
 must be non-zero on the irrationals, and is thus a discontinuous-everywhere
 function.
 The derivative of the Minkowski Question Mark function is interpretable
 as a measure, and is often called the 'Minkowski measure'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Two results are presented here: First, a simple measure-theoretic construction
 of the derivative, which can be precisely modeled on the real number line
 as a statistical distribution.
 This allows the distribution to be graphed, and clearly shows that it resembles
 what are sometimes called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

multi-fractal measures
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Second, an exact result, expressing the measure as an infinite product
 of piece-wise continuous functions, with each piece being a Möbius transform
 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $(ax+b)/(cx+d)$
\end_inset

, is presented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Minkowski Question Mark function was introduced by Hermann Minkowski
 in 1904 as a continuous mapping from the quadratic irrationals to the rational
 numbers
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Mink04"

\end_inset

.
 This mapping was based on the consideration of Lagrange's criterion, that
 a continued fraction is periodic if and only if it corresponds to a solution
 of a quadratic equation with rational coefficients.
 Minkowski's presentation is breif, but is based on a deep exploration of
 continued fractions.
 Minkowski does provide a graph of the function; a modern version of this
 graph is shown in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:The-Minkowski-Question"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arnaud Denjoy gave a detailed study of the function in 1938
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Den38"

\end_inset

, giving both a simple recursive definition, as well as expressing it as
 a summation.
 Its connection to the continued fractions allowed him to provide explicit
 expressions for its self-similarity, described as the action of Möbius
 transformations.
 Although Denjoy explores a generalization that is defined for the non-negative
 real number line, this essay will stick to Minkowski's original definition,
 defined on the unit interval.
 Little is lost by sticking to the original form, while keeping the exposition
 simpler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For rational numbers, Denjoy's summation is written as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
?\left(x\right)=2\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left(-1\right)^{k+1}\;2^{-(a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{k})}\label{eq:direct ? fun defn}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 are the integers appearing in the continued fraction
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Khin35"

\end_inset

 expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x=[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\cdots,a_{N}]=a_{0}+\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}+\frac{1}{a_{3}+\cdots}}}\]

\end_inset

For the case of general, irrational 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, one simply takes the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

; it is not hard to show that the resulting function is well-defined and
 continuous in the classical sense of delta-epsilon limits.

\begin_layout Standard
The function is symmetric in that 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(1-x\right)=1-?\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, and it has a fractal self-similarity which is generated by

\frac{1}{2}?\left(x\right)=?\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\label{eq:self-similarity}\end{equation}

\end_inset

An equivalent, alternative definition of the function can be given by stating
 that it is a correspondence between rationals appearing in the Stern-Brocot,
 or Farey tree, and the binary tree of dyadic rationals, shown in figure
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:trees"

\end_inset

; it maps the Farey tree into the dyadic tree.

\begin_layout Standard
Many insights into the nature and structure of the function, including self-simi
larity and transformation properties, can be obtained by contemplating the
 repercussions of this infinite binary-tree representation.
 Most important is perhaps the insight into topology: the presence of the
 tree indicates a product toplogy, and guarentees that the Cantor set will
 manifest itself in various ways.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this text is structured as follows: the next section introduces
 the derivative, or 'Minkowski measure', as the statistical distribution
 of the Farey numbers over the unit interval.
 The third section reviews the lattice-model or cylinder-set topology for
 binary strings, and presents an exact result for the Minkowski measure
 in this topology.
 This results disproves a conjecture by Mayer
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "May91"

\end_inset

 that the distribution is given by the Kac model
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Kac1959"

\end_inset

.
 In the penultimate section, the language of lattice models is converted
 back to the standard topology on the real number line, to give an exact
 result for the measure as an infinite product of piece-wise 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\infty}$
\end_inset

 functions, with each piece taking the form of a Möbius transform 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(ax+b\right)/\left(cx+d\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Minkowski Measure 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be shown that the Stern-Brocot or Farey tree enumerates all of the
 rationals in the unit interval exactly once
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Bog96"

\end_inset

.
 By considering this tree as a statistical experiment, as the source of
 values for a random variable, one obtains a statistical distribution; this
 distribution is exactly the Minkowski measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The statistical experiment may be run as follows: consider the first 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 rows of the tree: these provide a pool of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{N}$
\end_inset

 rationals.
 A random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{N}$
\end_inset

 is then defined by picking randomly from this pool, with equal probability.
 Ultimately, the goal is to consider the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\lim_{N\to\infty}X_{N}$
\end_inset

, and understand its distribution.
 From the measure-theory perspective, one is interested in the the probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pr$
\end_inset

 that a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 will fall in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[a,b]$
\end_inset

 of the real number line.
 The distribution is the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 underlying this probability: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr\left[a\le X<b\right]=\int_{a}^{b}d\mu=\int_{a}^{b}\mu\left(x\right)\, dx\]

\end_inset

It is straightforward to perform this experiment, for finite 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, on a computer, and to graph the resulting distribution.
 This is shown in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:Distribution-of-Farey"

\end_inset

.
 What is most notable about this figure is perhaps that it clearly belongs
 to a class of functions called 'multi-fractal measures'

\begin_layout Standard
This figure shows a histogram of the first 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{N}=65536$
\end_inset

 Farey fractions according to their location on the unit interval.
 To create this figure, the unit interval is divided up into 
\begin_inset Formula $M=600$
\end_inset

 bins, and the bin count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{m}$
\end_inset

 for each bin 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is incremented whenever a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 falls within the bin: 
\begin_inset Formula $(m-1)/M\leq p/q<m/M$
\end_inset

.
 At the end of binning, the count is normalized by multiplying each bin
 count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $M/2^{N}$
\end_inset

.
 The normalization ensures that the histogram is of measure one on the unit
 interval: that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{m=0}^{M}c_{m}=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shape of this histogram is dependent on the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 However, it does exactly capture the results of performing an experiment
 on the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{N}$
\end_inset

 and tallying the results into evenly-spaced bins.
 The result is 'exact' in the sense of eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:integral"

\end_inset

: the height of each bin is precisely given by the differences of the value
 of ? at its edges, up to the granularity imposed by 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

, the errors are uniformly bounded and vanishing.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is known as the 'Minkowski measure'; its relationship to the Question Mark
 function is straight-forward, and may be stated as a formally:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem*
The integral of the Stern-Brocot distribution is the Minkowski Question
 Mark function; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
?\left(b\right)-?\left(a\right)=\int_{a}^{b}d\mu\label{eq:integral}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The result follows from the duality of the ordinary dyadic tree and the
 Stern-Brocot tree.
 Consider a different statistical experiment, performed much as before,
 but where this time, one picks fractions from the dyadic tree.
 Call the resulting random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, understood as the limit of discrete variables 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{N}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Since the dyadic rationals are uniformly distributed on the unit interval,
 the corresponding measure is trivial: its just the uniform distribution.
 Yet this 'trivial' experiment differs from that giving 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 only by the labels on the tree.
 Performing the same experiment, in the same way, but just with different
 labellings of the values, is simply a mapping from one set to another;
 the mapping is already given by eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:direct ? fun defn"

\end_inset

, it is 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The transformation of measures under the action of maps is a basic result
 from probability theory; the relationship between the random variables
 is simply that 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{N}=?\left(X_{N}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=?\left(X\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The measure, of course, transforms inversely, and so by standard measure
 theory, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr\left[a\le X<b\right]=?(b)-?(a)\]

\end_inset

essentially, concluding the proof of the assertion 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:integral"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:integral"

\end_inset

 resembles a classical integral, one is sorely tempted to 'abuse the notation',
 and use the classical notation to write: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{d?\left(x\right)}{dx}=?^{\prime}\left(x\right)=\mu\left(x\right)\label{eq:abuse}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The use of the derivative notation in the above is rather misleading: properly
 speaking, the derivative of the Question Mark is not defined when using
 the standard topology on the real number line.
 Yet this notation is not exactly wrong; the modern definition of a derviative
 must occur with respect to a topology, and if one uses the appropriate
 toplogy, the derivative notation is accurate.
 In essence, the 'abuse of notation' is the failure to distinguish the standard
 topology of the real number line, from the product topology in which the
 statistical experiments are performed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proof of the equivalence was given in terms of random variables, and
 the usual topology of random variables is a product topology (see, for
 example 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Kle08"

\end_inset

), which is a very different topology than the standard topology on the
 real number line.
 For a discrete random variable taking on values from some set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, the appropriate space for studying 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 successive measurements is the product space 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{M}=S\times\dots\times S$
\end_inset

.
 The open sets of a product topology are the cylinder sets.
 Points in the product topology are simply strings of symbols, chosen from
 the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 However, by considering the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

 of the binary digits 0,1, one can map strings of binary digits to real
 numbers expanded in base-two.
 This mapping effectively leads to the notion of the Cantor set, and, as
 a result, can provide a grounding for understanding a wide spectrum of
 fractal phenomena.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The product topology is also the setting for the so-called 'lattice models'
 of statistical physics.
 The next section explicitly develops the basic vocabulary of lattice models.
 The notion of fractal self-similarity can then be explicitly equated to
 shifts (translations) of the lattice.
 Equiped with this new vocabulary, it becomes possible to give an exact
 expression for the Minkowski measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 to be expressed as an infinite product of Mobius functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Lattice models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section provides a review of the language of lattice models, setting
 up a minimal vocabulary needed for the remaining development.
 The use of lattice models is partly suggested by the developments above:
 the natural setting for probability theory is the product topology, and
 the natural setting for the product topology is the lattice model.
 The specific applicability of lattice models to the Minkowski measure is
 made clear in a later section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the set of all possible (infinite length) strings in two letters.
 Each such string can be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\ldots)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}\in\{-1,+1\}$
\end_inset

.
 These strings can be trivially equated to binary numbers, by writing the
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th binary digit as 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=(\sigma_{k}+1)/2$
\end_inset

, so that for each configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma,$
\end_inset

 one has the real number 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}b_{k}2^{-\left(k+1\right)}\label{eq:binary-number}\end{equation}

\end_inset

In physics, such strings are the setting for one-dimensional lattice models,
 the most famous of which is the Ising model.
 One considers each number 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to represent a position in space, a lattice point.
 At each lattice point, one imagines that there is an atom, interacting
 with its neighbors, forming a perfect crystal.
 The goal of physics is to describe the macroscopic properties of this crystal
 given only microscopic details.
 There are two critical details that enter into all such models: the principle
 of maximum entropy, and translational invariance.
 These two principles, taken together, allow the Minkowski measure to be
 specified in an exact way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principle of maximum entropy states that all possible states of the
 model should be equally likely, subject to obeying any constraints that
 some or another average value or expectation value of a function of the
 lattice be fixed.
 There is a unique probability distribution that satisfies the principle
 of maximum entropy, it is known as the 
\emph on
Boltzmann distribution
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
Gibbs measure
\emph default
.
 It is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Pr(\sigma)=\frac{1}{Z(\Omega)}\;\exp\left(-\beta H\left(\sigma\right)\right)\label{eq:Gibbs measure}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pr\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 denotes the probability of seeing the configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The normalizing factor 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)$
\end_inset

 is known as the 
\emph on
partition function
\emph default
, it exists to ensure that the sum of all probabilities totals unity.
 That is, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
Z\left(\Omega\right)=\sum_{\sigma\in\Omega}\exp\left(-\beta H\left(\sigma\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is the set of all possible configurations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 is a real-valued function, conventionally called the 'energy' or 'Hamiltonian'
 in physics.
 The principle of maximum entropy interprets the energy as something whose
 expectation value is to be kept constant; that is, one adjusts the free
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in order to obtain a desired value for the expectation value 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle H\right\rangle =\frac{1}{Z\left(\Omega\right)}\sum_{\sigma\in\Omega}H\left(\sigma\right)\exp\left(-\beta H\left(\sigma\right)\right)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second principle commonly demanded in physics is that of translational
 invariance: that, because the crystalline lattice 'looks the same everywhere',
 all results should be independent of any specific position or location
 in the lattice.
 In particular, translational invariance implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 should have the same form as one slides around left or right on the lattice.
 In the present case, the lattice is one-sided, and so one can slide in
 only one direction.
 Defining the shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 which acts on strings as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\ldots)=(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\sigma_{3},\ldots)$
\end_inset

, the principle of translation invariance states that we should only consider
 functions 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 obeying the identity 
\begin_inset Formula \[
H\left(\sigma\right)=H\left(\tau\sigma\right)\]

\end_inset

Unfortunately, for the present model, this cannot quite hold in the naive
 sense: the lattice is not double sided (with strings of symbols extending
 to infinity in both directions), but one-sided.
 The best one can hope for is to isolate the part that acts just on the
 first 'atom' in the left-most lattice location; call this part 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

, and subtract it from total: thus, instead, translational invariance suggests
 that, for the one-sided lattice, one should write 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H\left(\sigma\right)=V\left(\sigma\right)+H\left(\tau\sigma\right)\label{eq:translational symmetry}\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, the total 'energy' contained in the lattice is equal to the energy
 contained in the first lattice position, plus the energy contained in the
 remainder of the lattice.
 That the energy should be additive (as opposed to being multiplicative,
 or combined in some other way) is consistent with its use as a log-linear
 probability in the Gibbs measure; that is, the use of the Gibbs measure,
 together with insistence that the model be translationally invariant, implies
 that the energy must be additive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this, it is is straight-forward to decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 into a sum: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}V\left(\tau^{k}\sigma\right)\label{eq:hamilton-potential}\end{equation}

\end_inset

What remains is the 'potential' 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

, which embodies the specifics of the problem at hand.
 The primary result of this note follows from the application of the above
 mechanics to the Minkowski measure: that is, to assume that the Minkowski
 measure is a Gibbs measure, and to solve for the potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before doing so, there is one more relationship to make note of: the shift
 operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau,$
\end_inset

 when looked at from the point of view as a function on real numbers, looks
 like division-by-two.
 To be precise, one has the identity 
\begin_inset Formula \[
2^{k}x\left(\sigma\right)-\left\lfloor 2^{k}x\left(\sigma\right)\right\rfloor =x\left(\tau^{k}\sigma\right)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lfloor y\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 denotes the floor of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 The left-hand side of the above is a central ingredient of the construction
 of the Takagi or 'blancmange' curve; such a curve may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{k}f\left(2^{k}x-\left\lfloor 2^{k}x\right\rfloor \right)\]

\end_inset

for various functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 of the unit interval.
 Such functions have many curious fractal self-similarity properties, and
 are explored in greater detail in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Ve-T04,Ve-M04"

\end_inset

.
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $W=f\circ x$
\end_inset

 shows that the Blancmange curve has the form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{k}W\left(\tau^{k}\sigma\right)\]

\end_inset

when considered on the lattice.
 The mapping given by eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:binary-number"

\end_inset

 is not just a mapping between strings and real numbers, it is a mapping
 from the product topology to the natural topology of the real number line.
 Thus, suddenly, many fractal and self-similarity phenomena are seen to
 be manifestations of simple structures in the product topology, which are
 then mapped to the natural topology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Self-Similarity 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why should one even consider the application of lattice models to the Minkowski
 measure? The core justification is that the shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 essentially acts as a division-by-two, when considered on binary the numbers
 
\begin_inset Formula $x\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 of eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:binary-number"

\end_inset

, together with the divide-by-two self-similarity relation in eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:self-similarity"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, one posits that there is a probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Pr\left(\sigma\right)=\left(?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1}\right)\left(x\left(\sigma\right)\right)\label{eq:Jacobian}\end{equation}

\end_inset

that is described by the Gibbs measure.
 The appearance here of the inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{-1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is so as to be able to work 'in the same space' as where one started: that
 is, 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{-1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is a map that takes one from the space of dyadics to the space of Farey
 fractions, where an operation is performed that coincidentally takes one
 back to the space of dyadics.
 Seen in this way, eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Jacobian"

\end_inset

 is essentially a Jacobian.

\begin_layout Standard
In 1991, Dieter Mayer hypothesized
\begin_inset LatexCommand citet
key "May91"

\end_inset

 that the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\ref{eq:Jacobian}$
\end_inset

 was given by the Kac model
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Kac1959"

\end_inset

, and specifically, by the Kac potential
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
V(x)=\begin{cases}
2x-1/2 & \quad\mbox{ for }0\le x\le1/2\\
-2x+3/2 & \quad\mbox{ for }1/2\le x\le1\end{cases}\label{eq:Kac potential}\end{equation}

\end_inset

while taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1$
\end_inset

.
 The conjecture appears entirely reasonable, at least at the numerical level:
 inserting this into the Gibbs measure yields a graph that appears to be
 more-or-less equal the Question Mark, up to the level of numerical detail
 that can be easily achieved.
 However, Mayer does not provide a proof; rather, he intimates that it must
 be so.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, numerical efforts suggest that there are many functions 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 that 'come close', and can serve as the basis for similar conjectures.
 Loosening the restriction of translational invariance, to allow Hamiltonians
 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{k}V\left(\tau^{k}\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 seems to allow an ever richer collection of functions V that seem to yield
 good numerical approximations to the Question Mark.
 The Kac potential is simply a special case; as originally formulated, it
 is an interaction that decays exponentially with distance.
 Written in terms of interations between lattice points, this exponential
 decay takes the form 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{k}\sigma_{0}\sigma_{k}$
\end_inset

 .
 Why there should be so many functions that seem to approximate the Question
 Mark is not immediately apparent; perhaps it is a statement that functions
 that seem 'close to' one another with respect to the natural topology of
 the unit interval have dramatically different form when considered in the
 product topology of the lattice model.

An exact solution has been promised; it is time to present it.
 To obtain the solution, one 'follows one's nose'.
 Starting with
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr(x)=\left(?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1}\right)(x)\]

\end_inset

one clearly has 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pr(?(x))=?^{\prime}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Applying the symmetry from eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:self-similarity"

\end_inset

, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)=\Pr\left(?\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\right)=?^{\prime}\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\]

\end_inset

The division-by-two is to be recognized as the shift operator.
 That is, using translational symmetry 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:translational symmetry"

\end_inset

 in the Gibbs measure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 yields 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr\left(\sigma\right)=\exp\left(-V\left(\sigma\right)\right)\Pr\left(\tau\sigma\right)\]

\end_inset

or equivalently, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)=\exp\left(-V\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)\right)\Pr\left(?(x)\right)\]

\end_inset

Back-substituting, one deduces
\begin_inset Formula \[
?^{\prime}\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)=?^{\prime}(x)\;\exp\left(-V\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

On the other hand, one has
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{?^{\prime}(x)}{2}=\frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}}?^{\prime}\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\]

\end_inset

which may be obtained by naively differentiating the relation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 The casual use of differentiation here deserves some remark; it is justified
 by the same arguments that allow the

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Formula $V(y)=V(1-y)$
\end_inset

 When graphed, this potential does appear to be vaguely tent-like, thus

The remaining terms of the product need to be evaluated by considering the

 Under the change of variable, this is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau^{k}\sigma=?^{-1}\left(\mbox{frac}\left(2^{k}?\left(y\right)\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

where 'frac' is the fractional part of a number, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{frac}\left(x\right)=x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor $

\begin_inset Formula \[
A_{k+1}\left(y\right)=A_{k}\circ A\left(y\right)\]

\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}\left(y\right)=y$

 Each of the

The structure of the product can be elucidated by relating it to the structure
 of the dyadic monoid
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

 A monoid is just a group, but without inverses; composing two elements
 of a monoid simply gives anothr element of the monoid.
 The dyadic monoid is a free monoid generated by two elements 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, with with 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{2}=e$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 Alternately, the dyadic monoid is the free monoid in two letters 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

; both presentations can be seen to correspond to a binary tree.
 In essence, the dyadic monoid consists of those moves that can navigate
 down an infinite binary tree.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this problem, the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)=y/(1-y)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r(y)=1-y$
\end_inset

 are the generators of the dyadic monoid.
 Explicitly, this is
\begin_inset Formula \[
A_{k+1}\left(y\right)=\begin{cases}
\left(A_{k}\circ g\right)\left(y\right)=A_{k}\left(\frac{y}{1-y}\right) & \mbox{\; for }0\le y<\frac{1}{2}\\
\left(A_{k}\circ r\circ g\circ r\right)\left(y\right)=A_{k}\left(\frac{2y-1}{y}\right) & \;\mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le y\le1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

Alternately, it can be convenient to work with the left 
\begin_inset Formula $L=g$
\end_inset

 and right 
\begin_inset Formula $R=r\circ g\circ r$
\end_inset

 transformations, with locations in the binary tree identified by navigating

 successive iterations of

 These navigate

 the tree; a point of occasional confusion can be avoided by keeping in
 mind that taking the inverse reverses the order of symbols, i.e.
 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(f\circ h\right)^{-1}=h^{-1}\circ f^{-1}$
\end_inset

 For example, the third row of the Stern-Brocot tree is given by

This is perhaps the most remarkable result of this development.
 That the Gibbs measure can be written as infinite product is no surprise.
 That repeated applications of the shift operator

 can be represented as the iteration of a function comes as no suprise either.
 That

 the self-similarity properties of the Question Mark.
 However, the expression for the potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

 Here, the potential is revealed to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

not just some arbitrary function

Several final remarks are in order.
 First, one has that the partition function 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 This is no accident, but was gaurenteed by construction.
 Forcing the relationship 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Jacobian"

\end_inset

, together with the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $?(1)=1$
\end_inset

, ensured that all normalizing factors that might have appeared in 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)$
\end_inset

 were in fact absorbed as an additive constant by 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Explicitly, this scaling leads to the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\log2$
\end_inset

 in eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caution should be used when evaluating eqn

 numerically.
 If preparing a graph, or numerically evaluating its integral, the product

\begin_inset Formula $N\le\log_{2}h$
\end_inset

 iterations, where 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is the step size for the numerical integral.
 Using 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

 larger than this bound will result in a very noisy sampling, resulting

The Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing Operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator is the transfer operator (also called
 the Perron-Frobenius-Ruelle operator) of the Gauss map 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)=1/x-\left\lfloor 1/x\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

.
 Denoting this operator as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{G}$
\end_inset

, it acts on a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{G}f\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\left(x+n\right)^{2}}\, f\left(\frac{1}{x+n}\right)\label{eq:gkw}\end{equation}

\end_inset

It has a well-known eigenfunction, corresponding to eigenvalue one, given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $1/(1+y)$
\end_inset

.
 It is also relatively straightforward to observe that the Minkowski measure
 is also an eigenfunction, also corresponding to eigenvalue one.
 This is readily seen by differentiating the Question Mark: one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}-\frac{?\left(x\right)}{2^{n}}\]

\end_inset

to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?^{\prime}\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)=\frac{\left(x+n\right)^{2}}{2^{n}}?^{\prime}\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

This can be directly inserted into eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:gkw"

\end_inset

 to very easily find that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{G}?^{\prime}=?^{\prime}\]

\end_inset

This result immediately suggests that the lattice model methods can be applied
 to find other eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues.
 
\end_layout

Before doing so, it is worth taking a moment to introduce another operator,
 a sort of twisted Bernoulli shift: this would be the transfer operator
 corresponding to the function 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 It is straight-forward to write this down; it is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{A}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}f\left(\frac{y}{1+y}\right)+\frac{1}{\left(2-y\right)^{2}}f\left(\frac{1}{2-y}\right)\]

\end_inset

Transfer operators, as formulated by David Ruelle[xxx need ref] are a commonly-u
sed tool for studying dynamical systems.
 The origin of the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes from lattice-model physics, where state information is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfered
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between neighboring sites on a lattice.
 A particularly simple and well-studied operator is the Bernoulli shift
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Dri99,Gas92,Has92"

\end_inset

; it is the transfer operator corresponding to multiplicatin by two.
 The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{A}$
\end_inset

 is a peculiar continued-fraction analog of the Bernoulli shift; it participates
 in various identities with the GKW operator
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Iso03"

\end_inset

.
 The Minkowski measure is also an eigenfunction of the twisted Bernoulli
 shift; that is, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{A}?^{\prime}=?^{\prime}\]

\end_inset

It is also worth noting that the self-similarity transforation of the Minkwoski
 measure resembles that of modular form
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Apo90"

\end_inset

.
 That is, given a general Möbius transform of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $(ax+b)/(cx+d)$
\end_inset

, with integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c,d$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ad-bc=1$
\end_inset

, the self-similarity of the Question Mark takes the form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?\left(\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\right)=\frac{M}{2^{N}}+\left(-1\right)^{Q}\;\frac{?\left(x\right)}{2^{K}}\]

\end_inset

for some integers 
\begin_inset Formula $M,N,Q,K$
\end_inset

, depending on the specific values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c,d$
\end_inset

.
 Differentianting the above, one readily obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?^{\prime}\left(\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\right)=\left(cx+d\right)^{2}\;\frac{?^{\prime}\left(x\right)}{2^{K}}\]

\end_inset

which is almost exactly the transformation rule for a modular form of weight
 2, and is spoiled only by the factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{K}$
\end_inset

.
 It would be of some interest to find other measures, transforming with
 different weights.

\begin_layout Standard
Other eigenfunctions for the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{G}$

 up out of analytic functions in a regular way.
 It is hoped that perhaps these techniques, especially the latter, can be
