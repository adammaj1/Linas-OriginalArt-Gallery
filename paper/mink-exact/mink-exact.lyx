\begin_layout Abstract
The Minkowski Question Mark function relates the continued-fraction representati
on of the real numbers, to thier binary expansion.
 Although it is difficult to reason about its derivative, one can show by
 classical techniques that its derivative must vanish on all rationals.
 Since the Question Mark itself is continuous, one concludes that the deriviatvi
e must be non-zero on the irrationals, and is thus a discontinuous-everywhere
 function.
 The derivative of the Minkowski Question Mark function is interpretable
 as a measure, and is often called the 'Minkowski measure'.

\begin_layout Abstract
Two results are presented here: First, a graphical image of this measure,
 clearly showing that it resembles what are commonly called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

multi-fractal measures
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Next, an exact result, expressing the measure as an infinite product of
 piece-wise continuous functions, with each piece being a Mobius transform
 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $(ax+b)/(cx+d)$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Minkowski Question Mark function was introduced by Minkowski in 1904
 as an example of ...
 (XXX why did he do this?)
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Mink04"

\end_inset

; it is shown in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:The-Minkowski-Question"

\end_inset

.
 A simple recursive definition was given by Denjoy in 1938
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Den38"

\end_inset

.
 For rational numbers, it can simply be expressed the summation 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
?\left(x\right)=2\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left(-1\right)^{k+1}\;2^{-(a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{k})}\label{eq:direct ? fun defn}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 are the integers appearing in the continued fraction
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Khin35"

\end_inset

 expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x=[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\cdots,a_{N}]=a_{0}+\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}+\frac{1}{a_{3}+\cdots}}}\]

\end_inset

 For the case of general, irrational 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, one simply takes the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

; it is not hard to show that the resulting function is well-defined and
 continuous in the classical sense of delta-epsilon limits.

\begin_layout Standard
The function is symmetric in that 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(1-x\right)=1-?\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, and it has a fractal self-similarity
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Ve-M04"

\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{2}?\left(x\right)=?\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\]

\end_inset

An equivalent, alternative definition of the function can be given by stating
 that it is a correspondence between rationals appearing in the Stern-Brocot,
 or Farey tree, and the binary tree of dyadic rationals, shown below; it
 maps the Farey tree into the dyadic tree.

\begin_layout Standard
Many insights into the nature and structure of the function, including self-simi
larity and transformation properties, can be obtained by contemplating the
 reprecussions of this inifinite-tree representation.
 Most important is perhaps the insight into topology: the presence of the
 tree indicates that the Cantor set will manifest itself in various ways.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this text is structured as follows: the next section introduces
 the derivative, or 'Minkowski measure', as the statistical distribution
 of the Farey numbers over the unit interval.
 The third section reviews the lattice-model or cylinder-set topology for
 binary strings, and presents an exact result for the Minkowski measure
 in this topology.
 This results disproves a conjecture by Mayer
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "May91"

\end_inset

 that the distribution is given by the Kac model.
 In the penultimate section, the language of lattice models is converted
 back to the standard topology on the real number line, to give an exact
 result for the measure as an infinite product of piece-wise 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\infty}$
\end_inset

 functions, with each peice taking the form of a Mobius transform 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(ax+b\right)/\left(cx+d\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Minkowski Measure 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be shown that the Stern-Brocot or Farey tree enumerates all of the
 rationals in the unit interval exactly once
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Bog96"

\end_inset

.
 It is interesting to consider this tree as a statistical experiment, as
 the source of values for a random variable, resulting in a statistical
 distribution.
 The result of this experiment is the Minkowski measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment may be run as follows: consider the first 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 rows of the tree: these provide a pool of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{N}$
\end_inset

 rationals.
 The random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{N}$
\end_inset

 is then defined by picking randomly from this pool, with equal probability.
 Ultimately, the goal is to consider the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\lim_{N\to\infty}X_{N}$
\end_inset

, and understand its distribution.
 From the measure-theory perspective, one is interested in the the probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pr$
\end_inset

 that a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 will fall in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[a,b]$
\end_inset

 of the real number line.
 The distribution is the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 underlying this probability: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr\left[a\le X<b\right]=\int_{a}^{b}d\mu=\int_{a}^{b}\mu\left(x\right)\, dx\]

\end_inset

It is straightforward to perform this experiment, for finite 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, on a computer, and to graph the resulting distribution.
 This is shown in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:Distribution-of-Farey"

\end_inset

.
 What is most notable about this figure is perhaps that it clearly belongs
 to a class of functions called 'multi-fractal measures'

\begin_layout Standard
This figure shows a histogram of the first 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{N}=65536$
\end_inset

 Farey fractions according to their location on the unit interval.
 To create this figure, the unit interval is divided up into 
\begin_inset Formula $M=600$
\end_inset

 bins, and the bin count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{m}$
\end_inset

 for each bin 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is incremented whenever a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 falls within the bin: 
\begin_inset Formula $(m-1)/M\leq p/q<m/M$
\end_inset

.
 At the end of binning, the count is normalized by multiplying each bin
 count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $M/2^{N}$
\end_inset

.
 The normalization ensures that the histogram is of measure one on the unit
 interval: that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{m=0}^{M}c_{m}=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shape of this histogram is dependent on the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 However, it does exactly capture the results of performing an experiment
 on the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{N}$
\end_inset

 and tallying the results into evenly-spaced bins.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is known as the 'Minkowski measure'; its relationship to the Question Mark
 function is straight-forward: it is simply 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
?\left(b\right)-?\left(a\right)=\int_{a}^{b}d\mu\label{eq:integral}\end{equation}

\end_inset

That this is so is easily seen by the duality of the ordinary dyadic tree
 and the Stern-Brocot tree.
 Consider instead a different statistical experiment, performed much as
 before, but where this time, one picks fractions from the dyadic tree.
 Call the resulting random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, understood as the limit of discrete variables 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{N}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Since the dyadic rationals are uniformly distributed on the unit interval,
 the corresponding measure is trivial: its just the uniform distribution.
 Performing the same experiment, in the same way, but just with different
 labellings of the values, is simply a mapping from one set to another;
 the map is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The relationship between the random variables is simply that 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{N}=?\left(X_{N}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=?\left(X\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The measure, of course, transforms inversely, and so by standard measure
 theory, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr\left[a\le X<b\right]=?(b)-?(a)\]

\end_inset

essentially, concluding the proof of the assertion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:integral"

\end_inset

 resembles a classical integral, one is sorely tempted to succumb to this
 temptation, and use classical notation to write: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d?\left(x\right)}{dx}=?^{\prime}\left(x\right)=\mu\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the deriviative notation in the above is rather misleading: properly
 speaking, the derivative of the Question Mark is not defined when using
 the standard topology on the real number line.
 Yet this notation is not exactly wrong; it's simply that a gloss has happened
 along the way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proof of the equivalence was given in terms of random variables, and
 the usual topology of random variables is a product topology (see, for
 example x), which is a very different topology than the standard topology
 on the real number line.
 For a discrete random variable taking on values from some set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, the appropriate space for studying 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 successive measurements is the product space 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{M}=S\times\dots\times S$
\end_inset

.
 The open sets of a product topology are the cylinder sets.
 Points in the product topology are simply strings of symbols, chosen from
 the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 However, by considering the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

 of the binary digits 0,1, one can intentionally confuse strings of binary
 digits with binary numbers.
 This intentional confusion leads very naturally to the Cantor set, and
 related phenomena, as well as to the language of lattice models.
 The next section explicitly develops the idea of a lattice model, which
 allows for a non-trivial exact result.

\begin_layout Standard
It is constructive to restate the above results in the language of lattice
 models
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the set of all possible (infinite length) strings in two letters.
 Each such string can be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\ldots)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}\in\{-1,+1\}$
\end_inset

.
 These strings can be trivially equated to binary numbers, by writing the
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th binary digit as 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=(\sigma_{k}+1)/2$
\end_inset

, so that for each configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma,$
\end_inset

 one has the real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}b_{k}2^{-\left(k+1\right)}\]

\end_inset

One assigns a real valued number 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

, conventionally called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\emph on
energy

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in physics, to each lattice configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 This number is used to determine the probability, or measure, of a given
 lattice configuration, by means of the 
\emph on
Boltzmann distribution
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
Gibbs measure
\emph default
.
 This probability is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P(\sigma)=\frac{1}{Z(\Omega)}\;\exp\left(-\beta H\left(\sigma\right)\right)\label{eq:Gibbs measure}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is an adjustable parameter of the theory.
 The normalizing factor 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)$
\end_inset

 is known as the 
\emph on
partition function
\emph default
, it exists to ensure that the sum of all probabilities totals unity.
 That is, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
Z\left(\Omega\right)=\sum_{\sigma\in\Omega}\exp\left(-\beta H\left(\sigma\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is the set of all possible configurations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The Gibbs measure is remarkable in that it is the unique measure that maximizes
 the entropy over all possible configurations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 of eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Gibbs measure"

\end_inset

 can be directly equated with the measure in eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Cantor-measure"

\end_inset

.
 Doing so leads to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\beta H\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}v^{k}\log\,\tilde{s}_{w}\left(2^{k}x\left(\sigma\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

 The correspondence can be furthered by introducing the shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 which acts on strings as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\ldots)=(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\sigma_{3},\ldots)$
\end_inset

.
 This leads to the relation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
2^{k}x\left(\sigma\right)-\left\lfloor 2^{k}x\left(\sigma\right)\right\rfloor =x\left(\tau^{k}\sigma\right)\]

\end_inset

 and so one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\beta H\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}v^{k}\log\, s_{w}\left(x\left(\tau^{k}\sigma\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

 This can be compared to translation-invariant Hamiltonians, which take
 the form of 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}V\left(\tau^{k}\sigma\right)\label{eq:hamilton-potential}\end{equation}

\end_inset

It has been observed by Dieter Mayer 
\begin_inset LatexCommand citet
key "May91"

\end_inset

 that the potential function 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
V(x)=\begin{cases}
2x-1/2 & \quad\mbox{ for }0\le x\le1/2\\
-2x+3/2 & \quad\mbox{ for }1/2\le x\le1\end{cases}\label{eq:Kac potential}\end{equation}

\end_inset

taken together with 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1$
\end_inset

 seems to make 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 become a very good approximation to the derivative of the question mark;
 that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
P\left(\sigma\right)\approx\left(?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1}\right)\left(x\left(\sigma\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

 It is easy to confirm by numerical methods that this approximation holds,
 and that it at least bit as good as the approximations given above.
 The potential energy given by eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Kac potential"

\end_inset

 leads to a model from statistical mechanics known as the Kac model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the language of lattice models, one can actually work backwards, and
 obtain an 
\emph on
exact

 expression for the potential
\begin_inset LatexCommand citet

.
 It is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
V(y)=\log2-2\log\left(1+?^{-1}(2y)\right)\qquad\mbox{for }0\le y\le\frac{1}{2}\label{eq:exact soln}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $V(y)=V(1-y)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2<x\le1$
\end_inset

.
 This potential, taken together with eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:hamilton-potential"

\end_inset

 and eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Gibbs measure"

\end_inset

, now gives an exact equality to the measure: one can write exactly that
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
P\left(\sigma\right)=\left(?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1}\right)\left(x\left(\sigma\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

The question arises, what is the relationship between the exact solution
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:exact soln"

\end_inset

, the Kac potential 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Kac potential"

\end_inset

, and the approximate results

\end_inset

? Why do all three of these forms have such similar probability distributions?
