\begin_layout Abstract
The Minkowski Question Mark function relates the continued-fraction representati
on of the real numbers, to their binary expansion.
 This function is peculiar in many ways; one is that its derivative is 'singular
'.
 One can show by classical techniques that its derivative must vanish on
 all rationals.
 Since the Question Mark itself is continuous, one concludes that the derivative
 must be non-zero on the irrationals, and is thus a discontinuous-everywhere
 function.
 This derivative is the subject of this essay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Various results are presented here: First, a simple but formal measure-theoretic
 construction of the derivative is given, making it clear that it has a
 very concrete existence as a Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure, and thus is safe
 to manipulate in various familiar ways.
 Next, an exact result is given, expressing the measure as an infinite product
 of piece-wise continuous functions, with each piece being a Möbius transform
 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $(ax+b)/(cx+d)$
\end_inset

.
 This construction is then shown to be the Haar measure of a certain transfer
 operator.
 A general proof is given that any transfer operator can be understood to
 be nothing more nor less than a push-forward on a Banach space; such push-forwa
rds induce an invariant measure, the Haar measure, of which the Minkowski
 measure can serve as a prototypical example.
 Some minor notes pertaining to it's relation to the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing
 operator, are made.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Minkowski Question Mark function was introduced by Hermann Minkowski
 in 1904 as a continuous mapping from the quadratic irrationals to the rational
 numbers
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Mink04"

\end_inset

.
 This mapping was based on the consideration of Lagrange's criterion, that
 a continued fraction is periodic if and only if it corresponds to a solution
 of a quadratic equation with rational coefficients.
 Minkowski's presentation is brief, but is based on a deep exploration of
 continued fractions.
 Minkowski does provide a graph of the function; a modern version of this
 graph is shown in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:The-Minkowski-Question"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arnaud Denjoy gave a detailed study of the function in 1938
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Den38"

\end_inset

, giving both a simple recursive definition, as well as expressing it as
 a summation.
 Its connection to the continued fractions allowed him to provide explicit
 expressions for its self-similarity, described as the action of Möbius
 transformations.
 Although Denjoy explores a generalization that is defined for the non-negative
 real number line, this essay will stick to Minkowski's original definition,
 defined on the unit interval.
 Little is lost by sticking to the original form, while keeping the exposition
 simpler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For rational numbers, Denjoy's summation is written as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
?\left(x\right)=2\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left(-1\right)^{k+1}\;2^{-(a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{k})}\label{eq:direct ? fun defn}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 are the integers appearing in the continued fraction
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Khin35"

\end_inset

 expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x=[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\cdots,a_{N}]=a_{0}+\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}+\frac{1}{a_{3}+\cdots}}}\]

\end_inset

For the case of general, irrational 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, one simply takes the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

; it is not hard to show that the resulting function is well-defined and
 continuous in the classical sense of delta-epsilon limits.

\begin_layout Standard
The function is symmetric in that 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(1-x\right)=1-?\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, and it has a fractal self-similarity which is generated by 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}?\left(x\right)=?\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\label{eq:self-similarity}\end{equation}

\end_inset

An equivalent, alternative definition of the function can be given by stating
 that it is a correspondence between rationals appearing in the Stern-Brocot,
 or Farey tree, and the binary tree of dyadic rationals, shown in figure
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:trees"

\end_inset

; it maps the Farey tree into the dyadic tree.

\begin_layout Standard
Many insights into the nature and structure of the function, including self-simi
larity and transformation properties, can be obtained by contemplating the
 repercussions of this infinite binary-tree representation.
 Most important is perhaps the insight into topology: the presence of the
 tree indicates a product topology, and guarantees that the Cantor set will
 manifest itself in various ways.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Question Mark has many peculiarities, and one is that it's derivative
 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

singular
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in an unexpected way.
 One can show, by classical techniques, that its derivative must vanish
 on all rationals: it is a very very flat function, as it approaches any
 rational.
 Since the Question Mark itself is continuous, one concludes that the derivative
 must be non-zero on the irrationals, and is thus a discontinuous-everywhere
 function.
 The derivative of the Minkowski Question Mark function is interpretable
 as a measure, and is often called the 'Minkowski measure'.
 It is this measure that is the subject of this essay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this text is structured as follows: the next section introduces
 the derivative, or 'Minkowski measure', as the statistical distribution
 of the Farey numbers over the unit interval.
 The third section reviews the lattice-model or cylinder-set topology for
 binary strings, while the fourth presents an exact result for the Minkowski
 measure in this topology.
 This results disproves a conjecture by Mayer
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "May91"

\end_inset

 that the distribution is given by the Kac model
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Kac1959"

\end_inset

.
 In the fifth section, the language of lattice models is converted back
 to the standard topology on the real number line, to give an exact result
 for the measure as an infinite product of piece-wise 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\infty}$
\end_inset

 functions, with each piece taking the form of a Möbius transform 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(ax+b\right)/\left(cx+d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The sixth section provides a short note on modularity; the seventh reviews
 some generalizations.
 The eight section introduces the transfer operator, the nineth section
 provides an abstract theoretical framework, demonstrating that the transfer
 operator should be regarded as a pushforward.
 This is found to induce an invariant measure, the Haar measure.
 The next section provides a grounding for the the previous abstract discussions
, illustrating each theoretical construction with its Minkowski measure
 analog.
 The next two sections review a twisted form of the Bernoulli operator,
 and the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator, respectively.
 The papaer concludes with a call to develop machinery to better understand
 the discrete eigenvalue spectrum of these operators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Minkowski Measure 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be shown that the Stern-Brocot or Farey tree enumerates all of the
 rationals in the unit interval exactly once
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Bog96"

\end_inset

.
 By considering this tree as a statistical experiment, as the source of
 values for a random variable, one obtains a statistical distribution; this
 distribution is exactly the Minkowski measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The statistical experiment may be run as follows: consider the first 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 rows of the tree: these provide a pool of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{N}$
\end_inset

 rationals.
 A random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{N}$
\end_inset

 is then defined by picking randomly from this pool, with equal probability.
 Ultimately, the goal is to consider the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\lim_{N\to\infty}X_{N}$
\end_inset

, and understand its distribution.
 From the measure-theory perspective, one is interested in the the probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pr$
\end_inset

 that a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 will fall in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[a,b]$
\end_inset

 of the real number line.
 The distribution is the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 underlying this probability: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr\left[a\le X<b\right]=\int_{a}^{b}d\mu=\int_{a}^{b}\mu\left(x\right)\, dx\]

\end_inset

It is straightforward to perform this experiment, for finite 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, on a computer, and to graph the resulting distribution.
 This is shown in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:Distribution-of-Farey"

\end_inset

.
 What is most notable about this figure is perhaps that it clearly belongs
 to a class of functions called 'multi-fractal measures'

This figure shows a histogram of the first 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{N}=65536$
\end_inset

 Farey fractions according to their location on the unit interval.
 To create this figure, the unit interval is divided up into 
\begin_inset Formula $M=600$
\end_inset

 bins, and the bin count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{m}$
\end_inset

 for each bin 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is incremented whenever a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 falls within the bin: 
\begin_inset Formula $(m-1)/M\leq p/q<m/M$
\end_inset

.
 At the end of binning, the count is normalized by multiplying each bin
 count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $M/2^{N}$
\end_inset

.
 The normalization ensures that the histogram is of measure one on the unit
 interval: that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{m=0}^{M}c_{m}=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shape of this histogram is dependent on the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 However, it does exactly capture the results of performing an experiment
 on the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{N}$
\end_inset

 and tallying the results into evenly-spaced bins.
 The result is 'exact' in the sense of eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:integral"

\end_inset

: the height of each bin is precisely given by the differences of the value
 of ? at its edges, up to the granularity imposed by 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

, the errors are uniformly bounded and vanishing.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is known as the 'Minkowski measure'; its relationship to the Question Mark
 function is straight-forward, and may be stated as a formally:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem*
The integral of the Stern-Brocot distribution is the Minkowski Question
 Mark function; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
?\left(b\right)-?\left(a\right)=\int_{a}^{b}d\mu\label{eq:integral}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The result follows from the duality of the ordinary dyadic tree and the
 Stern-Brocot tree.
 Consider a different statistical experiment, performed much as before,
 but where this time, one picks fractions from the dyadic tree.
 Call the resulting random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, understood as the limit of discrete variables 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{N}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Since the dyadic rationals are uniformly distributed on the unit interval,
 the corresponding measure is trivial: its just the uniform distribution.
 Yet this 'trivial' experiment differs from that giving 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 only by the labels on the tree.
 Performing the same experiment, in the same way, but just with different
 labellings of the values, is simply a mapping from one set to another;
 the mapping is already given by eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:direct ? fun defn"

\end_inset

, it is 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The transformation of measures under the action of maps is a basic result
 from probability theory; the relationship between the random variables
 is simply that 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{N}=?\left(X_{N}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=?\left(X\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The measure, of course, transforms inversely, and so by standard measure
 theory, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr\left[a\le X<b\right]=?(b)-?(a)\]

\end_inset

essentially, concluding the proof of the assertion 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:integral"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:integral"

\end_inset

 resembles a classical integral, one is sorely tempted to 'abuse the notation',
 and use the classical notation to write: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{d?\left(x\right)}{dx}=?^{\prime}\left(x\right)=\mu\left(x\right)\label{eq:abuse}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The use of the derivative notation in the above is rather misleading: properly
 speaking, the derivative of the Question Mark is not defined when using
 the standard topology on the real number line.
 However, the treatment of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 as a measure can be very rigorously founded.
 Specifically, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 can be seen to be an example of an outer measure; by the measure extension
 theorem (see, for example 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Kle08"

\end_inset

), an outer measure can be extended to a unique measure on the unit interval
 of the real number line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is done as follows.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $2=\{0,1\}$
\end_inset

 be the set containing two elements; let 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 be the (semi-)infinite product space 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2\times2\times\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 This space consists of all (infinitely-long) strings in two letters.
 An outer measure is a set function 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\,:\,2^{\omega}\to[0,\infty]$
\end_inset

 that is monotone (
\emph on
i.e
\emph default
.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\left(A\right)<\nu\left(B\right)$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subset B\subset2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

), that is sigma-subadditive (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 given any countable set 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},\, A_{2},\,\ldots$
\end_inset

 of subsets of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subset\bigcup_{k=0}^{\infty}A_{k}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\left(A\right)\le\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\nu\left(A_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 ) and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 of the empty set is zero.
 It is straight-forward to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1}$
\end_inset

 satisfies each of these properties for an outer measure; this essentially
 follows from the total ordering of the fractions on the Stern-Brocot tree
 (as well as the total ordering of the dyadic rationals on the dyadic tree).
 The remaining step is to notice that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 topology on 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 is the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

weak topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (sometimes called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cylinder set topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), and that the weak topology is finer than the natural topology on the
 real number line.
 That is, every subset of the unit interval of the real number line is also
 a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 The measure extension theorem then states that there is a single, unique
 measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\nu}$
\end_inset

 on the unit interval of the real number line that is identical to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 on all subsets of the unit interval.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is in this way that 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1}$
\end_inset

 should be understood as a measure on the unit interval, and, more precisely,
 a Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset

 is continuous and invertible (one-to-one and onto), then 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is a Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure as well.
 It is in this way that the use of the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

derivative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is not entirely inappropriate: Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures capture the
 essence of integration, and insofar as the integral is an anti-derivative,
 one can fairly casually talk about derivatives.
 In particular, later sections below will make use of the chain rule for
 derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(?\circ f\right)^{\prime}=\left(?^{\prime}\circ f\right)\cdot f^{\prime}$
\end_inset

; the validity of the chain rule in this context works, because it can be
 seen to be a change-of-variable of a Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The construction of 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is such that it is also a measure (an outer measure!) on the even finer
 topology of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 All these various points will be implicit in what follows, where a more
 casual language will be adopted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The product topology is also the setting for the so-called 'lattice models'
 of statistical physics.
 The next section explicitly develops the basic vocabulary of lattice models.
 The notion of fractal self-similarity can then be explicitly equated to
 shifts (translations) of the lattice.
 Equipped with this new vocabulary, it becomes possible to give an exact
 expression for the Minkowski measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 to be expressed as an infinite product of Möbius functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Lattice models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section provides a review of the language of lattice models, setting
 up a minimal vocabulary needed for the remaining development.
 The use of lattice models is partly suggested by the developments above:
 the natural setting for probability theory is the product topology, and
 the natural setting for the product topology is the lattice model.
 The specific applicability of lattice models to the Minkowski measure is
 made clear in a later section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider again the set of all possible (infinite length) strings in two
 letters.
 Each such string can be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\ldots)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}\in\{-1,+1\}$
\end_inset

.
 These strings can be trivially equated to binary numbers, by writing the
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th binary digit as 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=(\sigma_{k}+1)/2$
\end_inset

, so that for each configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma,$
\end_inset

 one has the real number 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}b_{k}2^{-\left(k+1\right)}\label{eq:binary-number}\end{equation}

\end_inset

In physics, such strings are the setting for one-dimensional lattice models,
 the most famous of which is the Ising model.
 One considers each number 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to represent a position in space, a lattice point.
 At each lattice point, one imagines that there is an atom, interacting
 with its neighbors, forming a perfect crystal.
 The goal of physics is to describe the macroscopic properties of this crystal
 given only microscopic details.
 There are two critical details that enter into all such models: the principle
 of maximum entropy, and translational invariance.
 These two principles, taken together, allow the Minkowski measure to be
 specified in an exact way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principle of maximum entropy states that all possible states of the
 model should be equally likely, subject to obeying any constraints that
 some or another average value or expectation value of a function of the
 lattice be fixed.
 There is a unique probability distribution that satisfies the principle
 of maximum entropy, it is known as the 
\emph on
Boltzmann distribution
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
Gibbs measure
\emph default
.
 It is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Pr(\sigma)=\frac{1}{Z(\Omega)}\;\exp\left(-\beta H\left(\sigma\right)\right)\label{eq:Gibbs measure}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pr\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 denotes the probability of seeing the configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The normalizing factor 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)$
\end_inset

 is known as the 
\emph on
partition function
\emph default
, it exists to ensure that the sum of all probabilities totals unity.
 That is, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
Z\left(\Omega\right)=\sum_{\sigma\in\Omega}\exp\left(-\beta H\left(\sigma\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is the set of all possible configurations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 is a real-valued function, conventionally called the 'energy' or 'Hamiltonian'
 in physics.
 The principle of maximum entropy interprets the energy as something whose
 expectation value is to be kept constant; that is, one adjusts the free
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in order to obtain a desired value for the expectation value 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle H\right\rangle =\frac{1}{Z\left(\Omega\right)}\sum_{\sigma\in\Omega}H\left(\sigma\right)\exp\left(-\beta H\left(\sigma\right)\right)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second principle commonly demanded in physics is that of translational
 invariance: that, because the crystalline lattice 'looks the same everywhere',
 all results should be independent of any specific position or location
 in the lattice.
 In particular, translational invariance implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 should have the same form as one slides around left or right on the lattice.
 In the present case, the lattice is one-sided, and so one can slide in
 only one direction.
 Defining the shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 which acts on strings as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\ldots)=(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\sigma_{3},\ldots)$
\end_inset

, the principle of translation invariance states that we should only consider
 functions 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 obeying the identity 
\begin_inset Formula \[
H\left(\sigma\right)=H\left(\tau\sigma\right)\]

\end_inset

Unfortunately, for the present model, this cannot quite hold in the naive
 sense: the lattice is not double sided (with strings of symbols extending
 to infinity in both directions), but one-sided.
 The best one can hope for is to isolate the part that acts just on the
 first 'atom' in the left-most lattice location; call this part 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

, and subtract it from total: thus, instead, translational invariance suggests
 that, for the one-sided lattice, one should write 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H\left(\sigma\right)=V\left(\sigma\right)+H\left(\tau\sigma\right)\label{eq:translational symmetry}\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, the total 'energy' contained in the lattice is equal to the energy
 contained in the first lattice position, plus the energy contained in the
 remainder of the lattice.
 That the energy should be additive (as opposed to being multiplicative,
 or combined in some other way) is consistent with its use as a log-linear
 probability in the Gibbs measure; that is, the use of the Gibbs measure,
 together with insistence that the model be translationally invariant, implies
 that the energy must be additive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this, it is is straight-forward to decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 into a sum: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}V\left(\tau^{k}\sigma\right)\label{eq:hamilton-potential}\end{equation}

\end_inset

What remains is the 'potential' 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

, which embodies the specifics of the problem at hand.
 The primary result of this note follows from the application of the above
 mechanics to the Minkowski measure: that is, to assume that the Minkowski
 measure is a Gibbs measure, and to solve for the potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before doing so, there is one more relationship to make note of: the shift
 operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau,$
\end_inset

 when looked at from the point of view as a function on real numbers, looks
 like division-by-two.
 To be precise, one has the identity 
\begin_inset Formula \[
2^{k}x\left(\sigma\right)-\left\lfloor 2^{k}x\left(\sigma\right)\right\rfloor =x\left(\tau^{k}\sigma\right)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lfloor y\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 denotes the floor of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 The left-hand side of the above is a central ingredient of the construction
 of the Takagi or 'blancmange' curve; such a curve may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{k}f\left(2^{k}x-\left\lfloor 2^{k}x\right\rfloor \right)\]

\end_inset

for various functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 of the unit interval.
 Such functions have many curious fractal self-similarity properties, and
 are explored in greater detail in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Ve-T04,Ve-M04"

\end_inset

.
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $W=f\circ x$
\end_inset

 shows that the Blancmange curve has the form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{k}W\left(\tau^{k}\sigma\right)\]

\end_inset

when considered on the lattice.
 The mapping given by eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:binary-number"

\end_inset

 is not just a mapping between strings and real numbers, it is a mapping
 from the product topology to the natural topology of the real number line.
 Thus, suddenly, many fractal and self-similarity phenomena are seen to
 be manifestations of simple structures in the product topology, which are
 then mapped to the natural topology.

\begin_layout Section
Self-Similarity 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why should one even consider the application of lattice models to the Minkowski
 measure? The core justification is that the shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 essentially acts as a division-by-two, when considered on binary the numbers
 
\begin_inset Formula $x\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 of eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:binary-number"

\end_inset

, together with the divide-by-two self-similarity relation in eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:self-similarity"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, one posits that there is a probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Pr\left(\sigma\right)=\left(?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1}\right)\left(x\left(\sigma\right)\right)\label{eq:Jacobian}\end{equation}

\end_inset

that is described by the Gibbs measure.
 The appearance here of the inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{-1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is so as to be able to work 'in the same space' as where one started: that
 is, 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{-1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is a map that takes one from the space of dyadics to the space of Farey
 fractions, where an operation is performed that coincidentally takes one
 back to the space of dyadics.
 Seen in this way, eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Jacobian"

\end_inset

 is essentially a Jacobian.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1991, Dieter Mayer hypothesized
\begin_inset LatexCommand citet
key "May91"

\end_inset

 that the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\ref{eq:Jacobian}$
\end_inset

 was given by the Kac model
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Kac1959"

\end_inset

, and specifically, by the Kac potential
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
V(x)=\begin{cases}
-2x+1/2 & \quad\mbox{ for }0\le x\le1/2\\
2x-3/2 & \quad\mbox{ for }1/2\le x\le1\end{cases}\label{eq:Kac potential}\end{equation}

\end_inset

while taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1$
\end_inset

.
 The conjecture appears entirely reasonable, at least at the numerical level:
 inserting this into the Gibbs measure yields a graph that appears to be
 more-or-less equal the Question Mark, up to the level of numerical detail
 that can be easily achieved.
 However, Mayer does not provide a proof; rather, he intimates that it must
 be so.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, numerical efforts suggest that there are many functions 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 that 'come close', and can serve as the basis for similar conjectures.
 Loosening the restriction of translational invariance, to allow Hamiltonians
 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{k}V\left(\tau^{k}\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 seems to allow an ever richer collection of functions V that seem to yield
 good numerical approximations to the Question Mark.
 The Kac potential is simply a special case; as originally formulated, it
 is an interaction that decays exponentially with distance.
 Written in terms of interactions between lattice points, this exponential
 decay takes the form 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\sigma\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{k}\sigma_{0}\sigma_{k}$
\end_inset

 .
 Why there should be so many functions that seem to approximate the Question
 Mark is not immediately apparent; perhaps it is a statement that functions
 that seem 'close to' one another with respect to the natural topology of
 the unit interval have dramatically different form when considered in the
 product topology of the lattice model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An exact solution has been promised; it is time to present it.
 To obtain the solution, one 'follows one's nose'.
 Starting with
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr(x)=\left(?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1}\right)(x)\]

\end_inset

one clearly has 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pr(?(x))=?^{\prime}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Applying the symmetry from eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:self-similarity"

\end_inset

, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)=\Pr\left(?\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\right)=?^{\prime}\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\]

\end_inset

The division-by-two is to be recognized as the shift operator.
 That is, using translational symmetry 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:translational symmetry"

\end_inset

 in the Gibbs measure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Gibbs measure"

\end_inset

 yields 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr\left(\sigma\right)=\exp\left(-V\left(\sigma\right)\right)\Pr\left(\tau\sigma\right)\]

\end_inset

or equivalently, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Pr\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)=\exp\left(-V\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)\right)\Pr\left(?(x)\right)\]

\end_inset

Back-substituting, one deduces
\begin_inset Formula \[
?^{\prime}\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)=?^{\prime}(x)\;\exp\left(-V\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

On the other hand, one has
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{?^{\prime}(x)}{2}=\frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}}?^{\prime}\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\label{eq:meas-self-sim}\end{equation}

\end_inset

which may be obtained by naively differentiating the relation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 The casual use of differentiation here deserves some remark; it is justified
 by the same arguments that allow the

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Continuing, the last result is plugged in to yield 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset Formula $V$

\begin_inset Formula $V(y)=V(1-y)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2<x\le1$

 When graphed, this potential does appear to be vaguely tent-like, thus

The remaining terms of the product need to be evaluated by considering the

 Under the change of variable, this is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau^{k}\sigma=?^{-1}\left(\mbox{frac}\left(2^{k}?\left(y\right)\right)\right)\]

where 'frac' is the fractional part of a number, that is,

 A monoid is just a group, but without inverses; composing two elements
 of a monoid simply gives another element of the monoid.
 The dyadic monoid is a free monoid generated by two elements

 Alternately, the dyadic monoid is the free monoid in two letters 
\begin_inset Formula $L$

\begin_inset Formula $R$

 In essence, the dyadic monoid consists of those moves that can navigate

\begin_inset Formula $g(y)=y/(1-y)$

Alternately, it can be convenient to work with the left

 These navigate

 That the Gibbs measure can be written as infinite product is no surprise.

 That

 However, the expression for the potential

Several final remarks are in order.
 First, one has that the partition function 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)=1$

 This is no accident, but was guaranteed by construction.
 Forcing the relationship 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Jacobian"

\end_inset

, together with the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $?(1)=1$
\end_inset

, ensured that all normalizing factors that might have appeared in 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)$
\end_inset

 were in fact absorbed as an additive constant by 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Explicitly, this scaling leads to the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\log2$
\end_inset

 in eqn

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caution should be used when evaluating eqn

 numerically.
 If preparing a graph, or numerically evaluating its integral, the product

\begin_inset Formula $N\le\log_{2}h$

 iterations, where 
\begin_inset Formula $h$

 is the step size for the numerical integral.
 Using

Modularity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The self-similarity transformation of the Minkowski measure resembles that
 of a modular form
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Apo90"

\end_inset

.
 That is, given a general Möbius transform of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $(ax+b)/(cx+d)$
\end_inset

, with integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c,d$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ad-bc=1$
\end_inset

, the self-similarity of the Question Mark takes the form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?\left(\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\right)=\frac{M}{2^{N}}+\left(-1\right)^{Q}\;\frac{?\left(x\right)}{2^{K}}\]

\end_inset

for some integers 
\begin_inset Formula $M,N,Q,K$
\end_inset

, depending on the specific values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c,d$
\end_inset

.
 Differentiating the above, one readily obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?^{\prime}\left(\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\right)=\left(cx+d\right)^{2}\;\frac{?^{\prime}\left(x\right)}{2^{K}}\]

\end_inset

which is almost exactly the transformation rule for a modular form of weight
 2, and is spoiled only by the factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{K}$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests a conjecture: that there may be some holomorphic function,
 defined on the upper half-plane, for which the Minkowski measure is the
 limit of that function, the limit being taken a it's restriction to the
 real axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This conjecture is best illustrated numerically.
 Take the product 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, terminating it after a finite number of terms; then graph the reciprocal.
 The resulting graph fairly resembles what one would obtain, if, for example,
 one graphed the Dirichlet eta function along a horizontal line, not far
 above the real axis.
 The Dirichlet eta is a prototypical example of a modular form; that its
 also commonly written as an infinite product is also highly suggestive.
 These similarities bear further elucidation.

\Pr_{V}(\sigma)=\frac{1}{Z(\Omega)}\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}\exp\left(-V\left(\tau^{k}\sigma\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

A second important ingredient was to provide an explicit identification
 of lattice arrangements 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 with real numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 in the unit interval, given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=x^{-1}\left(?\left(y\right)\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Putting these together lead to the form 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P_{f}\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{Z\left(\Omega\right)}\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}f\circ A_{k}\left(y\right)\label{eq:defn-P_f}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The appearance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{k}$
\end_inset

 is explicitly governed by the mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=x^{-1}\left(?\left(y\right)\right)$
\end_inset

; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{k}$
\end_inset

 is a representation of the shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{k}$
\end_inset

, for this particular mapping of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 to real values.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-V$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(y\right)=\exp-V\left(x^{-1}\left(?\left(y\right)\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

The partition function 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)$
\end_inset

 is re-introduced as a reminder that the product definition only makes sense
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 has been scaled appropriately; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is arbitrary only up to a total scale factor; 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 exists only as an element of a projective space.
 The constraint is even stronger: inappropriately normalized 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 lead to the formal divergence 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)=\infty$
\end_inset

; there is only one normalization for which 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)$
\end_inset

 is finite, and that furthermore, by construction, one then has 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two directions along which to generalize are now clear: one may consider
 general functions 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, and one may consider different mappings from the lattice space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 to the unit interval (which is compact, or to the positive real number
 line, which is not).
 The former is reviewed in a later section; lets treat the later case first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most widely used mapping is usually the much simpler one: 
\begin_inset Formula $x=x\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 from eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:binary-number"

\end_inset

, instead of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

twisted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=x^{-1}\left(?\left(y\right)\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The simpler mapping is commonly used to study the Bernoulli shift
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Dri99,Gas92,Has92"

\end_inset

, an entry-point into the study of exactly solvable models in symbolic dynamics.
 By contrast, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

twisted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mapping allowed the Question mark to be properly formulated, thus suggesting
 that other maps can lead to other interesting objects.
 A twisted version of the Bernoulli Map will be presented in a later section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The product form 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:piece-product"

\end_inset

 provides the most concrete avenue immediately for generalizations.
 One need only to consider any differentiable, piece-wise function 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and use it in the construction.
 For example, one may consider a 3-adic generalization of the Question Mark,
 which may be constructed from 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
B\left(y\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{2y}{1-y} & \mbox{ for }0\le y<\frac{1}{3}\\
3y-1 & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{3}\le y<\frac{2}{3}\\
\frac{3y-2}{y} & \mbox{ for }\frac{2}{3}\le y\le1\end{cases}\label{eq:defn-B}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and using 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to generate the iterated function in the product, and 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{\prime}/3$
\end_inset

 in place of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\prime}/2$
\end_inset

 as the initial term.
 The resulting function, let's call it 
\begin_inset Formula $?_{3}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, can be integrated to define a 3-adic Question Mark 
\begin_inset Formula $?_{3}$
\end_inset

, which is shown in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:3-adic"

\end_inset

.
 Note that it requires no further normalization; one has 
\begin_inset Formula $?_{3}(1)=1$
\end_inset

 simply by having divided 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 by the number of branches of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 Visually, it is considerably less dramatic than the 2-adic Question Mark;
 hints of its self-similarity are visible but less apparent.

By construction, it has self-similarity, which can be immediately read off
 by considering

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?_{3}\left(\frac{2}{3-x}\right)=\frac{2}{3}+\frac{?\left(x\right)}{3}\]

\end_inset

These self-similarity properties allow an explicit equation for

\end_inset

 to be written out, entirely analogous to Denjoy's explicit summation given
 in eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

 Whether, or how, the 3-adic, or, more generally, a

 not clear.
 Of some curiosity is whether the feature that caused Minkowski to present
 the Question Mark, namely, Lagrange's result relating periodic continued

\begin_layout Section
The Transfer Operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mapping from the lattice to the unit interval results in a collision
 of effects coming from different topologies: the product topology of the
 lattice, and the natural topology of the real number line.
 A standard way of studying this collision is by means of the transfer operator.
 The goal of this section is to introduce the transfer operator; the next
 section will show, in general terms, that the transfer operator is the
 push-forward of the shift operator.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Transfer operators, also commonly called Perron-Frobenius operators or Perron-Fr
obenius-Ruelle operators, as formulated by David Ruelle[xxx need ref] are
 a commonly-used tool for studying dynamical systems
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Dri99"

\end_inset

.
 As the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Perron-Frobenius
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 suggests, these are bounded operators, whose largest eigenvalue is equal
 to one; the existence of this eigenvalue is commonly justified by appealing
 to the Frobenius theorem, which states that bounded operators have a maximal
 eigenvalue.
 The origin of the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes from lattice-model physics, where the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfer interaction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfer matrix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is studied
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Gutzwiller1990,Glimm1981,Kittel1976"

\end_inset

.
 In this context, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfer interaction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 describes the effect of neighboring lattice sites on one-another; it can
 be seen to be a matrix when the number of interacting lattice sites, and
 the number states a single lattice point can be in, is finite.
 It becomes an operator when the interaction is infinite range, or when
 the set of states at a lattice site is no longer finite.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easiest to begin with a concrete definition.
 Consider a function 
\begin_inset Formula $g:[0,1]\to[0,1]$
\end_inset

, that is, a function mapping the unit interval of the real number line
 to itself.
 Upon iteration, the function may have fixed points or orbits of points.
 These orbits may be attractors or repellors, or may be neutral saddle points.
 The action of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 may be ergodic or chaotic, strong-mixing or merely topologically mixing.
 In any case, the language used to discuss 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is inherently based on either the point-set topology of the unit interval,
 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 topology on the unit interval, the topology of open sets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A shift in perspective may be gained not by considering how 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 acts on points or open sets, but instead by considering how 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 acts on distributions on the unit interval.
 Intuitively, one might consider a dusting of points on the unit interval,
 with the local density given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset

 at point 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

, and then consider how this dusting or density evolves upon iteration by
 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 This verbal description may be given form as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\rho^{\prime}(y)=\int_{0}^{1}\,\delta\left(y-g(x)\right)\rho(x)\; dx\label{eq:transfer-dirac}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\prime}(y)$
\end_inset

 is the new density at point 
\begin_inset Formula $y=g(x)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the Dirac delta function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this viewpoint, 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 becomes an operator that maps densities 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 to other densities 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, or notationally, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{g}\rho=\rho^{\prime}\]

\end_inset

The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 is the transfer operator or the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator.
 It is not hard to see that it is a linear operator, in that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{g}(a\rho_{1}+b\rho_{2})=a\mathcal{L}_{g}\rho_{1}+b\mathcal{L}_{g}\rho_{2}\]

\end_inset

 for constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

 and densities 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1},\rho_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is differentiable, and doesn't have a vanishing derivative, the integral
 formulation of the transfer operator 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:transfer-dirac"

\end_inset

 can be rephrased in a more convenient form, as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{g}\rho\right]\left(y\right)=\sum_{x:y=g(x)}\frac{\rho(x)}{\left|dg(x)/dx\right|}\label{eq: transfer-jacobi}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the sum is presumed to extend over at most a countable number of points.
 That is, when 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is many-to-one, the sum is over the pre-images of the point 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both of the above definitions are mired in a language that implicitly assumes
 the real-number line, and its natural topology.
 Yet clearly, this is of limited utility; extracting the topology from the
 definition provides a clearer picture of the object itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Push-Forward
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, it will be shown that the transfer operator is the push-forward
 of the shift operator; a theorem and a sequence of lemmas will be posed,
 that hold in general form.
 The point of this theorem is to disentangle the role of topology, and specifica
lly, the role of measure theory, from the use of the shift operator.
 We begin with a general setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a topological space 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, and a field 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 over the reals 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 may be taken to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 itself, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 or some more general field over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The restriction of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 to being a field over the reals is is required, so that it can be used
 in conjunction with a measure; measures are always real-valued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may then define the algebra of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 as the set of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f:X\to F$
\end_inset

.
 An algebra is a vector space endowed with multiplication between vectors.
 The space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 is a vector space, in that given two functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1},f_{2}\in\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

, their linear combination 
\begin_inset Formula $af_{1}+bf_{2}$
\end_inset

 is also an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

; thus 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

 may be interpreted to be the vectors of a vector space.
 Multiplication is the point-wise multiplication of function values; that
 is, the product 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}f_{2}$
\end_inset

 is defined as the function 
\begin_inset Formula $(f_{1}f_{2})(x)=f_{1}(x)\cdot f_{2}(x)$
\end_inset

, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}f_{2}$
\end_inset

 is again an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

.
 Since one clearly has 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}f_{2}=f_{2}f_{1}$
\end_inset

, multiplication is commutative, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 is also a commutative ring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 may be endowed with a topology.
 The coarsest topology on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 is the 
\emph on
weak topology
\emph default
, which is obtained by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 to be the space that is topological dual to 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 As a vector space, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 may be endowed with a norm 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert f\right\Vert $
\end_inset

.
 For example, one may take the norm to be the 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{p}$
\end_inset

-norm 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\Vert f\right\Vert _{p}=\left(\int\left|f(x)\right|^{p}dx\right)^{1/p}\]

\end_inset

For 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2$
\end_inset

, this norm converts the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 into the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 Other norms are possible, in which case 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 has the structure of a Banach space rather than a Hilbert space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now a homomorphism of topological spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to Y$
\end_inset

.
 This homomorphism induces the pullback 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{*}:\mathcal{F}(Y)\to\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 on the algebra of functions, by mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $f\mapsto g^{*}(f)=f\circ g$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\circ g:Y\to F$
\end_inset

.
 The pullback is a linear operator, in that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{*}(af_{1}+bf_{2})=ag^{*}(f_{1})+bg^{*}(f_{2})\]

\end_inset

That the pullback is linear is easily demonstrated by considering how 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{*}f$
\end_inset

 acts at a point: 
\begin_inset Formula $(g^{*}f)(x)=(f\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$
\end_inset

 and so the linearity of 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{*}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $af_{1}+bf_{2}$
\end_inset

 follows trivially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may construct an analogous mapping, but going in the opposite direction,
 called the push-forward: 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}:\mathcal{F}(X)\to\mathcal{F}(Y)$
\end_inset

.
 There are two ways of defining a push-forward.
 One way is to define it in terms of the sheaves of functions on subsets
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 The sheaf-theoretic description is more or less insensitive to the ideas
 of measurability, whereas this is important to the definition of the transfer
 operator, as witnessed by the appearance of the Jacobian determinant in
 equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: transfer-jacobi"

\end_inset

.
 By contrast, the measure-theoretic push-forward captures this desirable
 aspect.
 It may be defined as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One endows the spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 with sigma-algebras 
\begin_inset Formula $(X,\mathcal{A})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(Y,\mathcal{B})$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 is the set of subsets of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 obeying the axioms of a sigma-algebra, and similarly for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 A mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to Y$
\end_inset

 is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measurable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if, for all Borel sets 
\begin_inset Formula $B\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

, one has the pre-image 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}(B)\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 being a Borel set as well.
 Thus, a measurable mapping induces a push-forward on the sigma-algebras:
 that is, one has a push-forward 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}:\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{A})\to\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{B})$
\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $f\mapsto g_{*}(f)=f\circ g^{-1}$
\end_inset

, which is defined by virtue of the measurability of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 The push-forward is a linear operator, in that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{*}(af_{1}+bf_{2})=ag_{*}(f_{1})+bg_{*}(f_{2})\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One regains the transfer operator as defined in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: transfer-jacobi"

\end_inset

 by considering the limiting behavior of the push-forward on progressively
 smaller sets.
 That is, one has
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
The transfer operator is the point-set topology limit of the measure-theoretic
 push-forward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The proof that follows is informal, so as to keep it simple.
 It is aimed mostly at articulating the language and terminology of measure
 theory.
 The result is none-the-less rigorous, if taken within the confines of the
 definitions presented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Introduce a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathcal{A}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}$
\end_inset

 and analogously 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}$
\end_inset

.
 The mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is measure-preserving if 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is a push-forward of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

, that is, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=g_{*}\mu=\mu\circ g^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 The measure is used to rigorously define integration on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 Elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{A})$
\end_inset

 can be informally understood to be integrals, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(A)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 may be understood as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(A)=\int_{A}\tilde{f}(z)d\mu(z)=\int_{A}\tilde{f}(z)\left|\mu^{\prime}(z)\right|dz\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mu^{\prime}(x)\right|$
\end_inset

 is to be understood as the Jacobean determinant at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in X$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{f}$
\end_inset

 can be understood to be a function that is being integrated over the set
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, whose integral is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $f(A)$
\end_inset

.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{f}$
\end_inset

 at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in X$
\end_inset

 can be obtained by means of a limit.
 One considers a sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

, each successively smaller than the last, each containing the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 One then has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{\overrightarrow{A\ni x}}\,\frac{f(A)}{\mu(A)}=\tilde{f}(x)\]

\end_inset

which can be intuitively proved by considering 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 so small that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{f}$
\end_inset

 is approximately constant over 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(A)=\int_{A}\tilde{f}(z)d\mu(z)\approx\tilde{f}(x)\int_{A}d\mu=\tilde{f}(x)\mu(A)\]

\end_inset

To perform the analogous limit for the push-forward, one must consider a
 point 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in Y$
\end_inset

 and sets 
\begin_inset Formula $B\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 containing 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 In what follows, it is now assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to Y$
\end_inset

 is a multi-sheeted countable covering of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 By this it is meant that for any 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 that is not a branch-point, there is a nice neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 such that its pre-image consists of the union of an at most countable number
 of pair-wise disjoint sets.
 That is, for 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 not a branch point, and for 
\begin_inset Formula $B\ni y$
\end_inset

 sufficiently small, one may write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{-1}(B)=A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup\cdots=\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}A_{j}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is either finite or stands for 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

, and where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}\cap A_{j}=\varnothing$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i\ne j$
\end_inset

.
 At branch points, such a decomposition may not be possible.
 The axiom of sigma-additivity guarantees that such multi-sheeted covers
 behave just the way one expects integrals to behave: in other words, one
 has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mu\left(g^{-1}(B)\right)=\mu\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}A_{j}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mu\left(A_{j}\right)\]

\end_inset

whenever the collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{j}$
\end_inset

 are pair-wise disjoint.
 Similarly, in order to have the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{A})$
\end_inset

 behave as one expects integrals to behave, one must restrict 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{A})$
\end_inset

 to contain only sigma-additive functions as well, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(g^{-1}(B)\right)=f\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}A_{j}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{k}f\left(A_{j}\right)\]

\end_inset

As the set 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is taken to be smaller and smaller, the sets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{j}$
\end_inset

 will become smaller as well.
 Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 the corresponding limit point of each 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{j}$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x_{j})=y$
\end_inset

 and the pre-image of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 consists of these points: 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}(y)=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\cdots\left|\, g(x_{j})=y\right.\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 One now combines these provisions to write 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\left[g_{*}\tilde{f}\right](y) & = & \lim_{\overrightarrow{B\ni y}}\,\left[\frac{\left(g_{*}f\right)(B)}{\nu(B)}\right]\nonumber \\
 & = & \lim_{\overrightarrow{B\ni y}}\,\left[\frac{\left(f\circ g^{-1}\right)(B)}{\nu(B)}\right]\nonumber \\
 & = & \lim_{\overrightarrow{A_{j}\ni g^{-1}(y)}}\,\frac{f\left(A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup\cdots\right)}{\nu(B)}\nonumber \\
 & = & \lim_{\overrightarrow{A_{j}\ni g^{-1}(y)}}\,\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{k}f\left(A_{j}\right)}{\nu(B)}\nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{j=1}^{k}\tilde{f}\left(x_{j}\right)\lim_{\overrightarrow{A_{j}\ni x_{j}}}\,\frac{\mu\left(A_{j}\right)}{\nu(B)}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The limit in the last line of this sequence of manipulations may be interpreted
 in two ways, depending on whether one wants to define the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 to be the push-forward of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

, or not.
 If one does take it to be the push-forward, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=g_{*}\mu$
\end_inset

, then one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{\overrightarrow{A_{j}\ni x_{j}}}\,\frac{\mu\left(A_{j}\right)}{g_{*}\mu(B)}=\frac{1}{\left|g^{\prime}\left(x_{j}\right)\right|}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|g^{\prime}\left(x_{j}\right)\right|$
\end_inset

 is the Jacobian determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 This last is a standard result of measure theory, and can be intuitively
 proved by noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(A_{j}\right)=B$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nu\left(B\right)=\int_{A_{j}}g^{\prime}(z)\, d\mu(z)\approx g^{\prime}\left(x_{j}\right)\mu\left(A_{j}\right)\]

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 Assembling this with the previous result, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[g_{*}\tilde{f}\right](y)=\sum_{x_{j}\in g^{-1}(y)}\frac{\tilde{f}\left(x_{j}\right)}{\left|g^{\prime}\left(x_{j}\right)\right|}\label{eq:Transfer-point}\end{equation}

\end_inset

which may be easily recognized as equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: transfer-jacobi"

\end_inset

.
 This concludes the proof of the theorem, that the transfer operator is
 just the point-set topology limit of the push-forward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In simplistic terms, the push-forward can be thought of as a kind of change-of-v
ariable.
 Thus, one should not be surprised by the following lemma, which should
 be recognizable as the Jacobian, from basic calculus.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
(Jacobian) One has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{x_{j}\in g^{-1}(y)}\frac{1}{\left|g^{\prime}\left(x_{j}\right)\right|}=1\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This follows by taking the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{A_{j}\ni x_{j}}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\mu\left(A_{j}\right)}{g_{*}\mu(B)}=\frac{\mu\left(A_{j}\right)}{\sum_{i=1}^{k}\mu\left(A_{i}\right)}\]

\end_inset

 and then summing over 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset LatexCommand label
name "cor:unit-eigenvec"

\end_inset

The uniform distribution (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 the measure) is an eigenvector of the transfer operator, associated with
 the eigenvalue one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This may be proved in two ways.
 From the viewpoint of point-sets, one simply takes 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{f}=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Transfer-point"

\end_inset

, and applies the lemma above.
 From the viewpoint of the sigma-algebra, this is nothing more than a rephrasing
 of the starting point, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=g_{*}\mu$
\end_inset

, and then taking the space 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=X$
\end_inset

, so that the push-forward induced by 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to X$
\end_inset

 is a measure-preserving map: 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}\mu=\mu$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last corollary is more enlightening when it is turned on its side; it
 implies two well-known theorems, which follow easily in this framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
(Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius theorem).
 All transfer operators are continuous, compact, bounded operators; furthermore,
 they are isometries of Banach spaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This theorem is of course just the Frobenius-Perron theorem, recast in the
 context of measure theory.
 By definition, the measures have unit norm: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \mu\right\Vert _{1}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \nu\right\Vert _{1}=1$
\end_inset

.
 This is nothing more than the statement that the spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 are measurable: the total volume of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is, by definition, one.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=g_{*}\mu$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert g_{*}\mu\right\Vert _{1}=1$
\end_inset

, and this holds for all possible measures 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\in\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Recall the definition of a bounded operator.
 Given a linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $T:U\to V$
\end_inset

 between Banach spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is bounded if there exists a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C<\infty$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert Tu\right\Vert _{V}\le C\left\Vert u\right\Vert _{U}$
\end_inset

for all 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U$
\end_inset

.
 But this is exactly the case above, with 
\begin_inset Formula $T=g_{*}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $U=\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\mathcal{F}(Y)$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $C=1$
\end_inset

.
 The norm of a bounded operator is conventionally defined as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\Vert T\right\Vert =\sup_{u\ne0}\frac{\left\Vert Tu\right\Vert _{V}}{\left\Vert u\right\Vert _{U}}=\sup_{\left\Vert u\right\Vert _{U}\le1}\left\Vert Tu\right\Vert _{V}\]

\end_inset

and so we have the norm of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

 being 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert g_{*}\right\Vert =1$
\end_inset

.
 That 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

 is an isometry follows trivially from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert g_{*}\mu\right\Vert _{1}=\left\Vert \nu\right\Vert _{1}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

 is linear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The corollary 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cor:unit-eigenvec"

\end_inset

 can also be treated as a corollary to the Perron-Frobenius theorem: namely,
 that there is at least one vector that corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 This eigenvector is in fact the Haar measure, as the next theorem shows.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset LatexCommand label
name "thm:Haar-measure"

\end_inset

(Haar measure) For any homomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to X$
\end_inset

, one may find a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}\mu=\mu$
\end_inset

; that is, every homomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 induces a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is a measure-preserving map.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is ergodic, then the measure is unique.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
By definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is a fixed point of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The fixed point exists because 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

is a bounded operator, and the space of measures is compact, and so a bounded
 operator on a compact space will have a fixed point.
 The existence of the fixed point is given by the Markov-Kakutani theorem
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
after "p 456"
key "Dunford1957"

\end_inset

.
 The Markov-Kakutani theorem also helps provide the uniqueness condition:
 if there are other push-forwards 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{*}$
\end_inset

 that commute with 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

, then each such push-forward will also have a fixed point.
 The goal is then to show that when 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is ergodic, there are no other functions 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 that commute with 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 But this follows from the definition of ergodicity: when 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is ergodic, there are no invariant subspaces, and the orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is the whole space.
 As there are no invariant subspaces, there are no operators that can map
 between these subspaces, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 there are no other commuting operators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A peculiar special case is worth mentioning: if 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is not ergodic on the whole space, then typically one has that the orbit
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 splits or foliates the measure space into a bunch of pairwise disjoint
 leaves, with 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 being ergodic on each leaf.
 The Markov-Kakutani theorem then implies that there is a distinct fixed
 point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 in each leaf, and that there is a mapping that takes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 in one leaf to that in another.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the language of dynamical systems, the push-forward 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

 is commonly written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

, so that one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{*}=\mathcal{L}_{g}\,:\,\mathcal{F}\left(X\right)\to\mathcal{F}\left(X\right)\]

\end_inset

now being called the transfer operator or the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the language of physics, the fixed point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ground state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a system.
 When it is unique, then the ground state is not degenerate; when it is
 not unique, then the ground state is said to be degenerate.
 The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

 is the time-evolution operator of the system; it shows how physical fields
 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 over a space 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 evolve over time.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is the complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

, the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert g_{*}\right\Vert =1$
\end_inset

 is essentially a way of stating that time-evolution is unitary; the Frobenius-P
erron operator is the unitary time-evolution operator of the system.
 What is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

second quantization
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in physics should be interpreted as the fitting of the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 with a set of basis vectors, together with a formulation of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

 in terms of that basis.

\begin_layout Section
Grounding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make sense of the discussion above, it is best to ground the symbols
 in concrete terms.
 For the most part, this paper is concerned either with the space 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\Omega$
\end_inset

, the space of strings in two letters, or the spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 that are somehow isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 This space is a (semi-)infinite product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{2}=\{0,1\}$
\end_inset

; elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\in\Omega$
\end_inset

 of this space were values 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\cdots)$
\end_inset

 with each 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}\in\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is to be equated with the shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

; that is, when 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\Omega$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $g=\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to X$
\end_inset

 is just 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau:\Omega\to\Omega$
\end_inset

 acting such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\cdots)=(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\cdots)$
\end_inset

.
 Curiously, the structure of the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 can be understood to be a binary tree: starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 one can branch to the left or to the right, to get to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

, and so on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, a product space such as this also allows the language of probability
 theory come into play, and this is where things get interesting.
 Product spaces are the natural setting for probability: the element 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\in\Omega$
\end_inset

 is called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random variable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and successive values 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measurements
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the random variable.
 This is also the manner in which measure theory gets its foot in the door.

The mappings 
\begin_inset Formula $x:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 given by eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:binary-number"

\end_inset

 is now seen to be an example of an element of the algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}\left(\Omega\right)$
\end_inset

 introduced in the previous section.
 The mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $y:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\mapsto y=?^{-1}\left(x\left(\sigma\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 is another example of an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}\left(\Omega\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Both the maps 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 are invertible on the closed unit interval, establishing a 
\begin_inset Formula $1-1$
\end_inset

 mapping between 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 and the closed unit interval.
 Consider, then, the function 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b=x\circ\tau\circ x^{-1}\]

\end_inset

which maps the unit interval into itself.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 be a point in the unit interval; then it is not hard to see that 
\begin_inset Formula $b(w)=2w\mbox{ mod}1$
\end_inset

.
 In the literature, this function is commonly called the Bernoulli shift;
 its corresponding random process is known as the Bernoulli process.
 It is well-known to be ergodic.
 The other function that was considered here was 
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=y\circ\tau\circ y^{-1}\]

\end_inset

Its action on the unit interval has already been given by eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:defn-A"

\end_inset

.
 In a previous section, we have already considered generalizations of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, that is, other functions 
\begin_inset Formula $B:[0,1]\to[0,1]$
\end_inset

, such as, for example, eqn

Each of these maps 
\begin_inset Formula $b$

 can be taken as an example of a map 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to X$
\end_inset

, now taking 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 to the unit interval.
 By the previous theorem, each such map 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 induces a push-forward 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}=\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

, and this push-forward then induces an invariant measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{g}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 For the Bernoulli map 
\begin_inset Formula $b$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{b}$

 is introduced in

key "Gas92,Has92"

\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Dri99"

\end_inset

.
 The invariant measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{b}$
\end_inset

 is well-known to be the identity on the unit interval.
 This just means that 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 considered as an ergodic process, is uniformly distributed on the unit

The invariant measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{A}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{A}=?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

Flightiness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To counterbalance the grounding, a brief bit of flightiness as to this process
 is offered up.
 The map 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to X$
\end_inset

, can be understood to give the (discrete) time-evolution of a dynamical
 system.
 It is curious to ponder that iterating on 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 can be thought of as the (semi-)infinite chain 
\begin_inset Formula \[
X\begin{array}[b]{c}
g\\
\longrightarrow\end{array}X\begin{array}[b]{c}
g\\
\longrightarrow\end{array}X\begin{array}[b]{c}
g\\

\end_inset

and so any particular 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, together with an initial state 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

, can be interpreted as selecting a particular sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},\ldots)$
\end_inset

 out of the (semi-)infinite product space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=X\times X\times X\times\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 The set membership function now defines a measure on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

: sets that contain sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},\ldots)$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k+1}=g\left(x_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 will have a non-zero measure, all others will have a measure of zero.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This now begs the question: what sort of operators might have this measure
 as their invariant measure? Which of these operators might be push-forwards?
 What would they be a push-forward of? Last but not least, all of the spaces
 under discussion are metric spaces, and so it would be curious to know
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what else is close by
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These questions are not entirely idle.
 The product space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 can be seen to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

space-time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; by analogy to the binary tree, the structure of this space-time is once-again
 seen to be branching; infinitely branching in this case.
 But such branching is already seen in physics: this is nothing other than
 the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, where, at each moment
 of time, the universe is seen to split into an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinite number of copies of itself
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The many-worlds branching structure is not well-explored or well-understood,
 although it can illuminate problems of quantum measurement and wave-function
 collapse.
 One such curious problem is the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mott problem
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The question that is posed by the Mott problem is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why does the spherically symmetric wave function of an emitted alpha-ray
 always leave a straight-line track in a Wilson cloud chamber?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The answer was given by Heisenberg and Mott in 1929; it can be re-interpreted
 in the context of the current formulation as a statement that straight-line
 tracks have a significant measure in this branching space-time, as they
 all correspond to sets that contain the point that is the spherical wave-functi
on, and no other sets do.
 But this is just an impressionistic daydream, lacking rigor; the hope is
 that it motivates further study.

\begin_layout Section
The Twisted Bernoulli Operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know consider the transfer operator or push-forward of the mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 It resembles the Bernoulli shift, but is twisted in a curious way; it is
 a continued-fraction analog of the Bernoulli shift.
 It is straight-forward to write it down; it is very simply 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{A}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}f\left(\frac{y}{1+y}\right)+\frac{1}{\left(2-y\right)^{2}}f\left(\frac{1}{2-y}\right)\]

\end_inset

This expression is easily obtained by starting with eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: transfer-jacobi"

\end_inset

 and substituting in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 from eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:defn-A"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, the Minkowski measure is an eigenfunction of the twisted Bernoulli
 shift; that is, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{A}?^{\prime}=?^{\prime}\]

\end_inset

This can be seen in several ways: The Minkowski measure was constructed
 as the Haar measure induced by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, and so by theorem 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "thm:Haar-measure"

\end_inset

, of course this identity must hold.
 But it can also be validated by more pedestrian methods: simply plug in
 the measure, and turn the crank, making use of the self-similarity relation
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:meas-self-sim"

\end_inset

 as needed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{A}$
\end_inset

 are readily found.
 Consider the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{f}$
\end_inset

 as previously defined in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:defn-P_f"

\end_inset

.
 The action of the twisted Bernoulli shift on 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{f}$
\end_inset

 is readily computed, and is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{A}P_{f}=P_{f}\cdot\mathcal{L}_{A}f\]

\end_inset

We've already observed that when 
\begin_inset Formula $f=A^{\prime}/2$
\end_inset

, that one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{A}\frac{A^{\prime}}{2}=1\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A^{\prime}/2}=?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 Another, linearly independent function which satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{A}f=1$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
C\left(y\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{3\left(1-y\right)^{3}} & \mbox{ for }0\le y\le\frac{1}{2}\\
\frac{1}{3y^{3}} & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le y\le1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

 that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{A}C=1$
\end_inset

.
 The collection of all 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 which satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{A}f=1$
\end_inset

 is large, but is easily specified.
 Let
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(y\right)=\begin{cases}
f_{0}\left(y\right) & \mbox{ for }0\le y\le\frac{1}{2}\\
f_{1}\left(y\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le y\le1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

then, given any, arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}$
\end_inset

, solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{A}f=1$
\end_inset

 results in 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f_{1}\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{y^{2}}-\frac{1}{\left(3y-1\right)^{2}}f_{0}\left(\frac{2x-1}{3x-1}\right)\]

\end_inset

Such 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 are properly scaled; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 Because of the projective relationship between the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and the normalization 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left(\Omega\right)$
\end_inset

, it appears that this technique will result in only in eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{f}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keep in mind that while 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{f+h}\ne P_{f}+P_{h}$
\end_inset

, such a relationship does hold in the logarithmic sense: 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{fh}=P_{f}P_{h}$
\end_inset

, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 can be construed to be a (logarithmic) homomorphism of Banach spaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing Operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing (GKW) operator is the transfer operator of the
 Gauss map 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)=1/x-\left\lfloor 1/x\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

.
 Denoting this operator as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{G}$
\end_inset

, it acts on a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{G}f\right](x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\left(x+n\right)^{2}}\, f\left(\frac{1}{x+n}\right)\label{eq:gkw}\end{equation}

\end_inset

It has a well-known eigenfunction, noted by Gauss, corresponding to eigenvalue
 one, given by 
\begin_inset Formula $1/(1+y)$
\end_inset

.
 It is also relatively straightforward to observe that the Minkowski measure
 is also an eigenfunction, also corresponding to eigenvalue one.
 This is readily seen by differentiating the Question Mark: one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}-\frac{?\left(x\right)}{2^{n}}\]

\end_inset

and so also 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?^{\prime}\left(\frac{1}{n+x}\right)=\frac{\left(x+n\right)^{2}}{2^{n}}?^{\prime}\left(x\right)\]

\end_inset

This can be directly inserted into eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:gkw"

\end_inset

 to very easily find that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{G}?^{\prime}=?^{\prime}\]

\end_inset

This result immediately suggests that the lattice model methods can be applied
 to find other eigenfunctions.
 (The 3-adic Question mark, at least as defined above, does not have this
 property, suggesting, perhaps, that a different 3-adic Question Mark should
 be formulated).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GKW operator is tied by various identities to the twisted Bernoulli
 operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{A}$
\end_inset

.
 These are explicitly given by 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Iso03"

\end_inset

; they can be crudely summarized by saying that these identities are the
 operator analogues of Denjoy's explicit summation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:direct ? fun defn"

\end_inset

.
 In these rough terms, the Bernoulli shift chops off one digit of a binary
 number at a time; these may be in turn re-assembled to form the GKW operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The action of the GKW operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{G}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{f}$
\end_inset

 is not at all tidy; the result that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{G}?^{\prime}=?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 appears to be entirely due to the special form of 
\begin_inset Formula $f=A^{\prime}/2$
\end_inset

.
 This is perhaps no surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other fractal eigenvectors for the GKW can be constructed by a technique
 entirely parallel to the construction of the 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{f}$
\end_inset

; one only has to use a different lattice model.
 For this model, construct 
\begin_inset Formula \[
R_{f}\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{Z\left(\Omega\right)}\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}f\circ D_{k}\left(y\right)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{k+1}=D_{k}\circ D$
\end_inset

 is function iteration, and
\begin_inset Formula \[
D\left(y\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1-y}{y} & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}<y\le1\\
\cdots & \cdots\\
\frac{1-ny}{y} & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{n+1}<y\le\frac{1}{n}\\
\cdots & \cdots\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

for positive integers 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 This multi-branched 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 has the property that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
D\left(\frac{1}{x+n}\right)=x\]

\end_inset

for all integer values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ge1$
\end_inset

.
 Applying the GKW operator to 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{f}$
\end_inset

 results in 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{G}R_{f}=R_{f}\mathcal{L}_{G}f\]

\end_inset

in analogy to the twisted Bernoulli operator.
 The means for finding solutions to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{G}f=1$
\end_inset

 proceeds analogously.
 Thus, let 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(y\right)=\begin{cases}
f_{1}\left(y\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}<y\le1\\
\cdots & \cdots\\
f_{n}\left(y\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{n+1}<y\le\frac{1}{n}\\
\cdots & \cdots\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

Then the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{G}f=1$
\end_inset

 established only a single constraint between these 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{n}$
\end_inset

's: all but one may be freely chosen.
 As an example, consider 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f_{n}\left(y\right)=\frac{a_{n}}{y^{2}}\]

\end_inset

Then the resulting 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{G}f=1$
\end_inset

 provided that the constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset

 satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}=1\]

\end_inset

This construction shows that the space of fractal eigenfunctions of the
 GKW operator is very large; but, as before, all of these eigenfunctions
 appear to be non-decaying, corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principal results of this note are the statistical distribution of equation
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:integral"

\end_inset

, which allows numerical explorations of the binary trees to be explicitly
 equated to the Minkowski measure, and equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:piece-product"

\end_inset

, which shows that the seemingly intractable Minkowski measure can be built
 up out of analytic functions in a regular way.
 A sufficient amount of formal theory is developed to show how to root this
 measure in a foundational apparatus, thus enabling various basic manipulations
 on it to be safely performed.
 Of these, the most notable was to expose the transfer operator as a push-forwar
d on a Banach space, leading to an interpretation of the Minkowski measure
 as a invariant measure, a Haar measure, induced by a dynamical map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important theme is the tension between the natural topology on the real
 number line, and the much finer 'weak topology' on the product space 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 It should be clear that the fine topology is the source for a broad variety
 for fractal, self-similar phenomena.
 The use of the measure extension theorem allows these fine-grained fractal
 phenomena to manifest themselves onto the natural topology; the Minkowski
 measure serves as a non-trivial yet still simple example of such a manifestatio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, various open problems remain.
 The most important of these surrounds the observation that transfer operators
 have a discrete spectrum, when the space of functions is restricted to
 a much smaller set, for instance, when it is restricted to the set of square-in
tegrable functions, or to the set of polynomials.
 In some cases, this spectrum can be obtained exactly; this has been done
 for the case of the Bernoulli operator 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Gas92,Has92,Dri99"

\end_inset

.
 More generally, obtaining this spectrum seems almost intractable; here,
 the prototypical example is the GKW operator.
 Of course, both the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the GKW operator
 can be computed numerically; however, there is no articulation or framework
 within which to talk about them and to manipulate them; they remain opaque.
 They seem to be mere holomorphic functions (by definition!) and oscillatory,
 of course; but there is not yet a way of writing down their power series
 directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, the open problem is to develop a technical framework that will identify
 the discrete eigenvalue spectrum of a transfer operator, and to directly
 provide expressions for the holomorphic functions which are their eigenvectors.
 Such a framework would be of broad utility.
