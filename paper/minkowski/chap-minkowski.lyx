\layout Abstract

Fractals and Continued Fractions seem to be deeply related in many ways.
 Farey Fractions appear naturally in both.
 Much of this relationship can be explained through the fact that the Modular
 Group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

 is the natural symmetry group of many fractals, including those associated
 with period-doubling maps and with phase-locking maps.
 Thus, we are motivated to study the Modular Group in greater detail.
 This paper provides a basic introduction to the group, and demonstrates
 several different representations, focusing primarily on the set-theoretic
 representations on the rationals.
 In particular, we find that the mapping between two of these representations
 is given by the Minkowski Question Mark Function, and thus, we can understand
 this strange, singular fractal function in terms of the Modular Group.

The Minkowski Question Mark Function
\layout Standard

This section explores a peculiar mapping involving Farey Numbers.
 Refered to as the Minkowski Question Mark, it is well-defined for all real
 numbers and maps the unit interval into, and onto, the unit interval.
 It is continuous and monotonic.
 The map, pictured below, is highly self-similar.
 It is also highly singular: all of its derivatives vanish on the rationals.
 Its self-similarity group can be clearly defined, and essentially that
 of period-doubling iterated maps, such as the Mandelbrot Set.
 The fact that it involves the Farey numbers is essentially the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

explanation
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 for why Farey Numbers occur in period-doubling maps.

Definition of the Question Mark Function
\layout Standard

The Minkowski Question Mark map can be constructed in several ways.
 In all of these constructions, it can be understood to be the mapping between
 the Stern-Brocot Tree (sometimes called the Farey Tree) and the tree of
 real numbers expressed as binary, base-2, dyadic fractions.
 The Stern-Brocot Tree is the tree on which the Farey mediants are naturally
 organized, and is most easily explained with a picture:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename fareytr.jpg

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

(See also the presenatation on 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[Stern Brocot Trees]{http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Stern.shtml}

\end_inset 

 at Cut-the-Knot.) The dyadic tree has the same shape, except that the second
 row holds the values 1/4 and 3/4, and the next row the values 1/8, 3/8,
 5/8 and 7/8, and so on.
 The dyadic tree holds values that are the arithmetic average, rather than
 the mediant, of the parent values.
 Both trees are 'binary' in the sense that each branch splits into two;
 we use the term 'dyadic tree' for the one that holds the 'dyadic' numbers
 
\begin_inset Formula $p/2^{k}$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

We denote the values of the Minkowski Question Mark function as as 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 Equating the Stern-Brocot Tree and the Dyadic Tree literally, one gets
 a recursive definition.
 Start by defining 
\begin_inset Formula $?(0)=0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $?(1)=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Then, for a pair of Farey fraction parents 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p'/q'$
\end_inset 

, it equates the Farey mediant to the arithmetic average:
\begin_inset Formula \[
?\left(\frac{p+p'}{q+q'}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left[?\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)+?\left(\frac{p'}{q'}\right)\right]\]

\end_inset 

Thus, starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{0}{1}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{1}$
\end_inset 

 at the root of the Farey Tree, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(\frac{0+1}{1+1}\right)=?\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left[?\left(\frac{0}{1}\right)+?\left(\frac{1}{1}\right)\right]=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 Next, we see the Farey number 1/3 is mapped to the binary 1/4, and so on:
 one quickly sees 
\begin_inset Formula $?\left(1/n\right)=2^{-n+1}$
\end_inset 

.
 Similarly, 2/3 maps to 3/4, and 
\begin_inset Formula $?(n/(2n-1))=2^{-1}+2^{-n}$
\end_inset 

.
 In general, a rational 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

 maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $?(p/q)=m\cdot2^{-n}$
\end_inset 

 for some integers 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n$
\end_inset 

 (every rational occurs exactly once on the Stern-Brocot Tree).
 
\layout Standard

Put another way, given any value 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 on the Stern-Brocot Tree, 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

 is the value at the corresponding position on the Dyadic Tree.
 It is convenient in the following to think of 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

 as a map from 'Farey Space' to 'Dyadic Space', and useful to keep in mind
 which of these two spaces one is currently working in.
 
\layout Standard

An alternate, non-recursive definition for the Question Mark is based on
 continued fractions.
 Starting with the expansion 
\begin_inset Formula $x=[a_{1},a_{2},...]$
\end_inset 

, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?(x)=2\sum_{k=1}\left(-1\right)^{k}\;2^{-(a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{k})}\]

\end_inset 

 This sum can be visualized as a count of an alternating sequence of 0's
 and 1's in the binary expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?(x)=\begin{array}{ccccc}
0.\underbrace{000...0} & \underbrace{11..1} & \underbrace{00..0} & \underbrace{11..1} & \underbrace{00..0}1..\\
a_{1}-1 & a_{2} & a_{3} & a_{4} & a_{5}\end{array}\]

\end_inset 

In this expnasion, it is useful to remember that 
\begin_inset Formula $0.111111...=1.0000...$
\end_inset 

, in case one has an odd number of terms in the continued fraction expansion.
\layout Standard

This sequence of 1's and 0's can be understood to be the set of directions
 for navigating a tree: on encountering a 0, take the left branch, else
 take the right branch.
 Thus, we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $0.011=LRR$
\end_inset 

.
 Navigating to this spot on the Stern-Brocot Tree, we find 2/5'ths.
 Navigating to this same position on the Dyadic Tree wee get 3/8'ths.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $?(2/5)=3/8$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

There is also a well-known representation of the Stern-Brocot Tree on the
 lattice 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z\mathbb{\times Z}}$
\end_inset 

, where a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

 is denoted as the ordered pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(p,q)$
\end_inset 

.
 In this representation, the left-right navigation operators 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset 

 have the values 
\begin_inset Formula $L=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & 1\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1\\
0 & 1\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset 

 and thus positions are given as elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 Maybe we'll elaborate on this later xxxx.
 To do...

To summarize, it is this expansion in binary digits that provides the underlying
 connection between period-doubling maps, such as the Mandelbrot Set, and
 Farey Numbers.
 Binary expansions, or code-words, occur naturally in the analysis of Duoady-Hub
bard landing rays.
 We'll demonstrate an explicit mapping in a later section.

Some Curious Properties of the Question Mark 
\layout Standard

The Question Mark has the curious property that it maps quadratic irrationals
 to rational numbers.
 A quadratic irrational is a number of the form m 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q+m\sqrt{D}/n$
\end_inset 

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $p,q,m,D,n$
\end_inset 

.
 Continued fractions whose expansions become eventually periodic are mapped
 to binary strings that become eventualy periodic.
 The later are clearly just the binary expansions of rationals whose denominator
 is not a power of 2.
 The former are quadratic irrationals, which is known from the theory of
 Pellian equations: It turns out that every quadratic irrational has a continued
 fraction expansion that becomes eventually periodic.
 Note that, as a side effect, this proves that quadratic irrationals are
 countable in the same way that rationals are.
\layout Standard

The Minkowski Question Mark has some very curious analytic properties: the
 mapping is continuous everywhere.
 It is also infinitely differentiable on every rational, and all derivatives
 vanish at every rational; yet the mapping is strictly montonically increasing.
 Clearly, the function is singular on irrationals.
 Its hard to define just how.
 (xxxx Blah blah need to define how).
\layout Standard

If there is a 3-adic or p-adic generalization of the Minkowski Question
 Mark, it is not obvious; one 'obvious' generalization is 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=1}\left(-1\right)^{k}\;3^{-(a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{k})}\]

\end_inset 

but its highly discontinuous.
 Other generalizations based on roots of unity in the complex plane also
 don't seem to work.
 One might be able to get traction by looking at groups that have 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

 as a subroup but also have some 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

-fold symmetry.
\layout Subsection

Symmetries of the Question Mark
\layout Standard

XXX write the intro again:...
 the symmetry is the group that maps trees to subtrees so the symmetry group
 of maping a binary tree onto itself in the modular group.
 XXX rewrite me.
 XXX also notice that the tree spans an inf-sup interval which is why this
 is an interval map and notice that trees don't span any arbitrary interval,
 but very specific intervals.
 
\layout Standard

It should be immediately appearent from the picture of the Question Mark
 that it is highly self-similar, and thus should have a group of symmetries.
 Below, we give an explicit presentation of this group, which turns out
 to be the Modular Group Gamma.
 After breifly presenting the modular group a bit, we point out that the
 'interesting' subset of the group, that is, 'interesting' as far as fractals
 are concerned, can be best enumerated as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\otimes\mathbb{N}\otimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 This enumeration will help cement that the modular group is the symmetry
 group of the Mandelbrot Set.
 I'm enamored of this development, because the popular literature on fractals
 always talks about self-similarity without ever actually giving the group
 structure that's involved.
 The goal here is to rectify this omission.
 
\layout Standard

We start by noticing that for any real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 having the continued fraction expansion 
\begin_inset Formula $x=[a_{1},a_{2},...]$
\end_inset 

, that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)=x/(1+x)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},...]$
\end_inset 

 .
 By the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

 one sees immediately that 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 is a homomorphism of the Question Mark: 
\begin_inset Formula $(?\circ g)(x)=?(g(x))=?(x)/2$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 represents one of the generators of the symmetry group.
 Denoting repeated iterations of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{n}$
\end_inset 

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{n}(x)=x/(1+nx)$
\end_inset 

.
 Equivalently, for a continued fraction, we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{n}([a_{1},a_{2},..])=[a_{1}+n,a_{2},...]\]

\end_inset 

 Iterating under the questino mark gives 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x/(1+nx))=?(x)/2^{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 The generator 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 maps intervals to intervals, specifically 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{n}:[[0,1]]\rightarrow[[0,\frac{1}{n+1}]]$
\end_inset 

 where we use the non-standard notation 
\begin_inset Formula $[[]]$
\end_inset 

 to denote an interval, to avoid confusion with 
\begin_inset Formula $[]$
\end_inset 

 for continued fraction expansions.
 On the dyadic side, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $(?g^{n}):[[0,1]]\rightarrow[[0,1/2^{n}]]$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

One gets the general symmetry group 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset 

 by combining with the reflection operator embodied in the left-right symmetry:
 
\begin_inset Formula $?(1-x)=1-?(x)$
\end_inset 

 which we denote with 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x)=1-x$
\end_inset 

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 commutes with 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset 

 as we have 
\begin_inset Formula $(?\circ r)(x)=(r\circ?)(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(?rg^{n})(x)=(r?g^{n})(x)=r\left(\frac{1}{2^{n}}?\right)(x)=1-?(x)/2^{n}=?\left(r\left(\frac{x}{1+nx}\right)\right)=?\left(\frac{1+(n-1)x}{1+nx}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $rg^{n}$
\end_inset 

 is the group element that, under 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset 

, maps 
\begin_inset Formula $[[0,1]]\rightarrow[[1,1-1/2^{n}]]$
\end_inset 

.
 We can now write a general group element as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\equiv g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}}$
\end_inset 

.
 Applying the above process, it is relatively straightforward to see that
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(?\gamma)(x)=(?g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}})(x)=\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}}}-\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}}}+\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}}}-...+(-)^{N+1}\frac{?(x)}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+...+a_{N}}}\]

\end_inset 

 To see the other leg of the homomorphism commuative diagram, we start by
 observing that we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{n}(x)$
\end_inset 

 itself as a continued fraction: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{n}(x)=\frac{1}{n+\frac{1}{x}}=[n,x]\]

\end_inset 

 In the same vein, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $(rg^{n})(x)=[1,n-1,x]$
\end_inset 

 and, with a slight abuse:
\begin_inset Formula \[
r(x)=\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{-1+\frac{1}{x}}}=[1,-1,x]\]

\end_inset 

 Continuing this excercise, one finds that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma(x)=(g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}})(x)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{N-1},a_{N}-1,x]\]

\end_inset 

 which is recognizable as an element of the group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 We present this group next.
\layout Subsection

The Modular Group Gamma or 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The modular group gamma is normally defined by its canonical representation
 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 In this standard representation, a general group element is representated
 by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a & b\\
c & d\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c,d$
\end_inset 

 being integers, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\gamma=ad-bc=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Elements of this group are isomorphic to a certain set of Mobius transforms
 on the upper-half complex plane; the isomorphism is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(x)=(ax+b)/(cx+d)$
\end_inset 

.
 The group elements are generated by a pair of generators.
 One generator generates the cyclic group of two elements 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}\equiv\mathbb{Z}/\left(2\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

 and the other generates the subgroup 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset 

.
 One can choose several different representations for the generators; the
 choice that is consistent with the previous section is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & 1\end{array}\right)\;\textrm{ and }\; r=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 1\\
0 & 1\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 This matrix representation of the generators can be used to manipulate
 and evaluate continued fractions; indeeed, the modular group is known as
 being one way to conveniently work with continued fractions.
 So, for example, we've already noted above that
\begin_inset Formula \[
g([a_{1},a_{2},...])=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},...]\]

\end_inset 

 Similarly, the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 is can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
r([a_{1},a_{2},..])=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
\;[1,a_{1}-1,a_{2},..] & \;\textrm{\; for \;} & a_{1}\neq1\\
\;[a_{2}+1,a_{3},...] & \textrm{\;\; for \;} & a_{1}=1\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

The operator to insert a digit 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq1$
\end_inset 

 at the front of the continued fraction expansion is thus 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(g^{n-1}rg)([a_{1},a_{2},...])=[n,a_{1},a_{2},...]\]

\end_inset 

which we can immediately verify as
\begin_inset Formula \[
(g^{n-1}rg)(x)=\left(\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
n-1 & 1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 1\\
0 & 1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
1 & 1\end{array}\right)\right):(x)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
1 & n\end{array}\right):(x)=\frac{1}{n+x}\]

\end_inset 

 Here we introduced 
\begin_inset Formula $:$
\end_inset 

 to denote the apply operator for the matrices; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a & b\\
c & d\end{array}\right):(x)=\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\]

\end_inset 

 It should be clear that we can now build up the continued fraction as desired
 with this insertion operator acting on zero: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(g^{j-1}rg)(g^{k-1}rg)(g^{m-1}rg)...(x)=(g^{j-1}rg^{k}rg^{m}rg...)(x)=[j-1,k,m,...,x]\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

One can also find the append operator, which we find by examining
\begin_inset Formula \[
[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},g^{k}(x)]=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N}+k,x]\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},r(x)]=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N}+1,-1,x]\]

\end_inset 

 We use these to construct the appending operator 
\begin_inset Formula $(g^{-1}rg^{k+1})(x)=(kx+1)/x$
\end_inset 

 which, for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq1$
\end_inset 

, acts as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},(g^{-1}rg^{k+1})(x)]=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},k,x]\]

\end_inset 

 We can thus build up continued fractions by appending at the back, starting
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $(g^{-1}rg)(x)=1/x=[x]$
\end_inset 

 as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(g^{-1}rg)(g^{-1}rg^{j+1})(g^{-1}rg^{k+1})(g^{-1}rg^{m+1})...(x)=(g^{j}rg^{k}rg^{m}rg...)(x)=[j,k,m,...,x]\]

\end_inset 

 arriving at the same answer as before.

A Theorm about an Isomorphism
\layout Standard

Lets restate the above results using modern mathematical notation and language.
 Let us denote with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 the set of real numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 that are represented by dyadic expansions; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\;\exists x_{D}\in\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 which represents the real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 as the dyadic expansion 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{D}$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{D}=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}b_{n}2^{n}\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} \;\forall k\in\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset 

.
 Let us use the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

 to denote the representation of the real numbers as continued fractions,
 that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\;\exists x_{C}\in\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{C}=a_{0}+\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2+...}}}=[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},...]\]

\end_inset 

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}\in\mathbb{N}\;\forall k\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

.
 Both of these sets are commonly treated as being isomorphic to the real
 numbers; they are just different representations of the real numbers.
 However, we can see that these two are not completely the same, because
 the group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

 has a different action on each.
 In particular, the group generator 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 has the representation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\begin{array}{c}
g_{D}:\mathbb{R}_{D}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}_{D}\\
g_{D}:x\longmapsto x/2\end{array}\]

\end_inset 

 when acting on the set of dyadic numbers, whereas as this same group element
 has the representation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\begin{array}{c}
g_{C}:\mathbb{R}_{C}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}_{C}\\
g_{C}:x\longmapsto x/(x+1)\end{array}\]

\end_inset 

 when acting on the set of continued fractions.
 The other generator 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 has the same representation on both sets: 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x)=1-x$
\end_inset 

.

\layout Description

Proof: We've already given the standard representations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 in these two spaces in previous sections, but we repeat these here just
 so that this is all crystal-clear.
 We first decompose an abstract group element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

 in terms of the generators 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

, as usual: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}}\]

\end_inset 

 Then, this 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 has the representation 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{D}$
\end_inset 

 which is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma_{D}(x)=\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}}}-\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}}}+\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}}}-...+(-)^{N+1}\frac{x}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+...+a_{N}}}\]

\end_inset 

 and it also has the representation 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{C}$
\end_inset 

 which is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma_{C}(x)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{N-1},a_{N}-1,x]\]

\end_inset 

 and thus we are able to write 
\begin_inset Formula $?(\gamma_{C}(x))=\gamma_{D}(?(x))$
\end_inset 

 as the isomorphism.
 To properly complete this proof, we would need to apply induction, that
 is, to show that if this equivalence holds for any one given 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

, then it also holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\gamma'$
\end_inset 

 for another 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma'\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

 and that it also holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $x+y$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

.
 We then would need to exhibit one group element for which this holds, and
 thus, by induction, conclude that it holds for all group elements and reals.
 One could try to give a very precise proof along these lines, but this
 is outside the scope of this text.
 It requires, among other things, talking about the completion of the rationals
 by the reals, and, if we are not careful, might also invoke the Axiom of
 Choice.
 See also the remarks below.

To summarize, we have exhibited an isomorphism of the real numbers onto
 themselves that demonstrates that there are really two distinct and inequivalen
t representations of the real numbers.
 When we say distinct and inequivalent, we really mean it: these two representat
ions transform radically differently under the Modular Group, although they
 are both isomorphic to that abstract set we call the reals, and are, through
 the Question Mark, isomorphic to each other.
\layout Standard

If we were better mathematicians, we would insist on a more watertight proof
 of this isomorphism, rather than the assertion that this is so.
 Unfortunately, we do not have the tools handy to provide this stronger
 proof.
 It is widely beleived that both the dyadics and the continued fractions
 are isomorphic to the reals, but this shouldn't entirely be taken for granted.
 In fact, we have already commited several grave errors.
 For one, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 is larger than the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

: as every student is told, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 contains the elements 0.11111...
 and 1.0000...
 which are clearly distinct in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 but represent the same number in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

.
 We have something similar happening in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

 in that a rational has the multiple representations 
\begin_inset Formula $[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n},\infty,a_{n+2},a_{n+3},...]$
\end_inset 

 where it does not matter what we pick for 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n+2}$
\end_inset 

, etc.
 Thus, one of our mistakes was to say 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 is isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

.
 Instead, it is only homomorphic, and there exists a homomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $e:\mathbb{R}_{D}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $e(0.1111...)=e(1.000...)$
\end_inset 

, thus implying that 
\begin_inset Formula $Ker\; e$
\end_inset 

 is non-trivial.
 We can then use 
\begin_inset Formula $Ker\; e$
\end_inset 

 to induce the desired isomorphism between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

.
 The existance of this homomorphism is widely accepted, but I don't know
 how to get there from first principles.
 Similar remarks apply to the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, having to work with quotient spaces introduces complexity into the
 correct proof.
 To this volatile mix, we have to add considerations of about the completion
 of the rationals by the reals.
 Clearly, the dyadic tree and the Stern-Brocot tree are order-preserving
 enumerations of the rationals.
 The correct completion of the dyadic tree appears to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 whereas the correct completion of the Stern-Brocot Tree appears to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

, and these two completions are not 
\emph on 
prima facae
\emph default 
 equivalent.
 If we can prove that there is only one, unique completion of the rationals
 by the reals, then we have proved the existance of the Minkowski Question
 Mark, and we thus arrive at the proof of the homomorphism of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

.
 But this is far from obvious from this vantage point.
 One problem is that proofs of completion might surreptiously invoke the
 Axiom of Choice; what one really wants are proofs of completion that start
 from a clean base, such as Zermelo-Fraenkel, and arrive at the homomorphism
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

, without invoking the Axiom of Choice.
 We start laying some of the groundwork for a proof of this type in a later
 section.

Fractal Symmetry and the Subset 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\otimes\mathbb{N}\otimes C_{2}$
\end_inset 

 of the Modular Group
\layout Standard

Every group element of 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$
\end_inset 

 can be decomposed into a combination of the 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 generators, of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}}$
\end_inset 

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}\in\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset 

.
 We've already discovered the relationship between the modular group and
 continued fractions, which we gave above as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma_{C}(x)=(g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}})(x)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{N-1},a_{N}-1,x]\]

\end_inset 

 We saw that this relation gives us the isomorphisms of the Minkowski Question
 Mark; let us now look at this a little more crefully and precisely, since,
 among other things, we need to define the domain and range over which the
 isomorphism is valid.
\layout Standard

First, let us consider the group elements with 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}\geq0$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{2}\geq1$
\end_inset 

, ...
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N-1}\geq1$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}\geq0$
\end_inset 

.
 When the coefficients are zero or positive like this, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{C}(x)$
\end_inset 

 maps the unit interval into strictly small intervals; 
\shape italic 
i.e.

\shape default 
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\gamma_{C}(0),\gamma_{C}(1)<1$
\end_inset 

.
 One endpoint of the interval are given by the rational 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{C}(0)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{N-1}]$
\end_inset 

 (note the missing 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}$
\end_inset 

).
 The other endpoint is 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{C}(1)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{N}]$
\end_inset 

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}\geq1$
\end_inset 

, although it must be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{C}(1)=[a_{1}+1,a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{N-2}]$
\end_inset 

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}=0$
\end_inset 

.
 This last special case is really just a reversal of the two endpoints.
 For such a 'shrinking' 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

, we can now write the isomorphism of the question mark as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
?(\gamma_{C}(x))=?(\gamma_{C}(0))+\frac{\left(-1\right)^{N+1}}{\left(2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{N}}\right)}?(x)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The best way of understanding this isomorphism is to think of it as an isomorphi
sm of intervals, where we can pick one end of the interval, but are a bit
 more constrained in picking the other end.
 That is, we can pick an arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{C}(0)=p/q\in\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset 

.
 We get the other end of the interval by picking 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{N}\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

 a positive integer.
 Having thus specified the interval, we can, for good measure, choose to
 exchange the endpoints, that is, pick one of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1,r\right\} \in C_{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

XXXX explain this: there are two ways to enumerate the tree remaps: tree-root
 to -tree-root.
 But the intervals are inf and sup of all the elements in the tree.
 The alternate map is to specify the inf of the tree (which is actually
 a real not a rational!!!) in which case one has a choice of tree roots,
 which are Z.
 The mirror reflection of the tree is of couse 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}$
\end_inset 

.

\layout Standard

To summarize, this set of isomorphisms of the question mark can be enumerated
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\otimes\mathbb{N}\otimes C_{2}$
\end_inset 

, which we'd like to call the fundamental set of symmetries.
 Note that this property of being able to freely pick one endpoint, but
 being a bit more contstrained with the other is a very important property
 of this symmetry.

So far, we've only enumerated some, but not all of the modular group.
 The inverse of our generator 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
-1 & 1\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 For the group element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}}$
\end_inset 

 we can quickly see that the inverse is 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{-1}=g^{-a_{N}}rg^{-a_{N-1}}r...rg^{-a_{1}}$
\end_inset 

.
 Its easy to see that these define the inverse mappings of smaller intervals
 onto the unit interval.
 Note that one needs to be careful when working with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{-1}(x)$
\end_inset 

 because this has poles that are just outside of the interval of the mapping.
 That is, the domain of the isomorphism is defined only on the interval
 of the mapping, and not the whole unit interval (its the range, not the
 domain, that is the whole unit interval).
 These inverse mappings can also be enumerated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\otimes\mathbb{N}\otimes C_{2}$
\end_inset 

, of course.
 
\layout Standard

All of the remaining group elements that we haven't yet discussed are those
 with a mixture of positive and negative values for the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset 

.
 These group elements can be obtained by alternately concatenating interval-shri
nking and interval-expanding group elements.
 One has to be considerably more careful in keeping track of the domains
 and ranges of each mapping.
 We claim (without proof at this time) that these types of mappings do not
 introduce any new types of intervals, and so enumeration originally provided,

\begin_inset Formula $(rg^{-2}rg^{2})(x)=x+2$

 this (to modulo or not to modulo?)

Note also that if we limit ourselves to alternately shrinking and growing
 interval maps that are stricly contained one inside the other, then we
 find a proper subroup of the modular group, whose group elements are now
 enumerated by pairs of intervals or .xxx.

 Again, the domain and range of these sub-symmetries are now limited.

Thus I think we can now conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 is an isomorphism of 
\begin_inset Formula $?$

The Set-Theoretic Representation of the Modular Group
\layout Standard

The canonical representation of the modular group elements by Mobius transforms
 is in fact a set-theoretic representation of the modular group.
 That is, let 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset 

 be a set, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{X}=\left\{ f[x]:X\rightarrow X\right\} $
\end_inset 

 be the set of all maps from the set to itself.
 Then we say that 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset 

 is a set-theortic representation of a group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset 

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists\rho:G\rightarrow\mathcal{F}_{X}$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall g\in G$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall x\in X$
\end_inset 

 that the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset 

 is a group homomorphism of the group into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}_{X}$
\end_inset 

.
 That is, the following two properties must hold: the identity element correspon
ds to the self-map: 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(e)[x]=x$
\end_inset 

 and that group multipliction corresponds to function composition: 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(g_{1}g_{2})[x]=(\rho(g_{1})\circ\rho(g_{2}))[x]=\rho(g_{1})[\rho(g_{2})[x]]$
\end_inset 

.
 If every map 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(g):X\rightarrow X$
\end_inset 

 is one-to-one and onto, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset 

 is a group homomorphism from 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset 

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{X}$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{X}$
\end_inset 

 is the symmetric group of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

Clearly, the canonical map 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\rho:\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a & b\\
c & d\end{array}\right)\mapsto\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\]

\end_inset 

 is such a group homomorphism for the modular group.
 Not only is is commutative, but it is also holds for all elements of the
 modular group.
 The set 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset 

 can be taken to be the field of rationals 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset 

 or as any of its closures 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

, although when studying modular forms, it is usually taken as the complex
 upper-half plane 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{+}=\{ z\in\mathbb{C}\, s.t.\,\textrm{Im}z\geq0\}$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

The Minkowski Question Mark suggests that there is another such representation,
 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $?\circ\rho$
\end_inset 

.
 Unfortunately, due to the nature of the construction, its not obvious if
 the representation can be made to hold for all group elements, although
 it clearly works on the subset of contracting group elements.
 lets see how far we can push this.
 In a similar vein, we will find other representations in 
\begin_inset Formula $GL(N)$
\end_inset 

 given by the self-similarity properties of the Takagi Curve [ref other
 chapter/paper].
 These representations will also be built from the subset of contracting
 group elements, and so we need a general discussion of how to extend the
 homomorphisms to all group elements.
 
\layout Standard

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $M=\{\gamma\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})\textrm{ s.t. }\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r...rg^{a_{N}}\textrm{ has }a_{k}>0\;\forall k\in\{1,..,N\}\}$
\end_inset 

 be the set of contracting group elements.
 We begin by noting that every 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\in M$
\end_inset 

 defines an open interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{\gamma}$
\end_inset 

 whose endpoints are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{D}(0)$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{D}(1)$
\end_inset 

.
 We'll be using this to generate the dyadic toplogy.
 Equivalently, we could have used the Farey numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{C}(0)$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{C}(1)$
\end_inset 

, which would generate a Farey topology; either way, these two can be made
 homeomorphic through the Minkowski Question Mark.
 This is most easily understood by realizing that both intervals are defined
 by subtrees; in one case, a subtree of the dyadic tree, and in the other
 case, by a subtree of the Stern-Brocot tree.
 Every contracting element uniquely defines a subtree; the mapping between
 contracting elements and subtrees is 1-1 and onto.
 The Minkowski Question Mark is an equivalence of trees, and so these intervals
 are really 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

the same thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 In the following, we will let 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(x)$
\end_inset 

 stand for either the one or the other set-theoretic representation, unless
 otherwise stated.
\layout Standard

Subtrees of trees are totally ordered, and so we have equivalently a total
 order of intervals (XXX should we define total order here?) That is, we
 have a simple theorm about interval intersection: given any two 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}\in M$
\end_inset 

, then one of the following three statements holds: 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{1}\cap\upsilon_{2}=\upsilon_{1}$
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{1}\cap\upsilon_{2}=\upsilon_{2}$
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{1}\cap\upsilon_{2}=\emptyset$
\end_inset 

.
 This total ordering of intervals follows from considering the tree representati
on: given two subtrees, one is either a subtree of the other, or they are
 non-interscting.
 
\layout Standard

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall\gamma\in M$
\end_inset 

, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{-1}(x)$
\end_inset 

 is well-defined on the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\upsilon$
\end_inset 

 and has a range (co-domain) over the entire unit interval.
 This implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}\in M$
\end_inset 

 we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $(\gamma_{1}\circ\gamma_{2}^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset 

 is well-defined on the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\upsilon_{2}$
\end_inset 

 and has a range (co-domain) over 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{1}$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, homomorphisms on 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset 

 extend naturally to all elements of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}^{-1}$
\end_inset 

as long as we restrict the mapping to the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 Next, we note that we can build chains in this way.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{2}\supset\upsilon_{3}$
\end_inset 

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $(\gamma_{2}^{-1}\gamma_{3})(x)$
\end_inset 

 has a domain of the entire unit interval, although its range is less than
 the whole interval.
 Still, the range is within the domain of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}$
\end_inset 

 and we have a natural extension to all group elements of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}^{-1}\gamma_{3}$
\end_inset 

 as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{2}\supset\upsilon_{3}$
\end_inset 

 holds.
 Thus, a set-theoretic homomorphism extends naturally to elements of the
 form 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}^{-1}\gamma_{3}\gamma_{4}^{-1}...$
\end_inset 

 where each 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{k}\in M$
\end_inset 

 and the set of relationships 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\upsilon_{2j}\supset\upsilon_{2j+1}\}$
\end_inset 

 hold between pairs of adjacent elements.
 There now remains the problem of what to do for cases of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{3}\supset\upsilon_{2}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon_{2}\cap\upsilon_{3}=\emptyset$
\end_inset 

.
 One can proceed somwhat delcately with the former, by understnading that
 the domain of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}^{-1}\gamma_{3}$
\end_inset 

 is smaller than the whole unit interval.
 For the latter, we do not have an intersection of intervals on which the
 homomorphism is naively valid.

The Topology of the Modular Group
\layout Standard

The relationship between continued fractions and elements of the modular
 group hint at an interesting topology of the modular group.
 A subset of the modular group can be mapped to the rationals, and thus
 any metric on the rationals, whether the normal one or a p-adic one, can
 be 'lifted' back up to the modular group.
 We then ask if this metric can be extended onto the whole group.
 This mapping also means that we can draw a continous curve in the modular
 group: that a subset of the modular group is diffeomorphic to the rationals.
 Thus, we are lead to ask, where else can we draw continuous curves in the
 modular group? What is the connectedness of those curves? Is the manifold
 simply connected, or in fact punctured an infinite number of times? But
 we also saw that the more natural mapping is between the contractive group
 elements and intervals, so that the set of contractive group elements is
 essentially an open covering of the unit interval.
 Thus, we have a number of confusing, inter-related ideas, and ask how they
 can be sorted out.
 The goal is to define and explore the topology of the modular group, by
 extending what we've learned for the contractive elements onto the whole
 group.

Misc junk

In the above sections, we have found the first steps of a set-theoretic
 representation of the modular group.
 If we consider the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}(x)=\gamma(1/x)$
\end_inset 

 then we see that it is the desired group homomorphism: for 
\begin_inset Formula $r=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N}]\in\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s=[b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{M}]\in\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset 

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tilde{\gamma}_{r}\circ\tilde{\gamma}_{s})(x)=\tilde{\gamma}_{r}(\tilde{\gamma}_{s}(x))=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},b_{1},b_{2},..,b_{M},1/x]$
\end_inset 

.
 And so we have demonstrated a mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho:SL(2,\mathbb{Z})\rightarrow\mathcal{F}_{\mathbb{R}}$
\end_inset 

 that maps 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\mapsto\tilde{\gamma}(x)=[a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{N},x]$
\end_inset 

.
 However, we are far from done: this map is not defined for all of the group

 is for those elements that have all of the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}>0$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

this property on some but not all of the group elements of SL(2,Z).
 (We've only done it for the cnatracting group elements, So we really need
 to extend this, possibly through topological arguments about the coverings,
 where we cover each ocurrance of a negative 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset 

 in the continued fraction with an open subset, and do the standard topological
 arguments about open coverings.
 We really need to get the full topological structure working here.
\layout Standard

Note also that in the above, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset 

 is the rationals 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset 

and so the symmetric group 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{X}$
\end_inset 

 is really kind-of like the power-set 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{X}$
\end_inset 

 which is of course kind-of like the reals 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 and so this is gobbledy-gook about extending the rationals to the reals.
 (Never mind the p-adic closures).
 So we are forced to contemplate a seemingly rather deep relationship between
 the real numbers and the Modular Group, and are prompted to assert that
 the real numbers (and not just the rationals) have a marvelous fractal
 symmetry.
 Furthermore, the natural conclusion of this argument is that the fractals
 are really the expression of what would otherwise be this deeper underlying
 bu hidden symmetry.

Put in a plug for that educator who is promoting the idea that Farey arithmetic
 is the

 and should be taught in grade-school curricula as such.
 Just as the reals are closed under addition and multiplication, they are
 also closed under this weird, freaky modular group aka Farey number operation.
 
\layout Subsection

Hyperbolic Rotations of Binary Trees
\layout Standard

Note that by imposing the modular group symmetry on the real number line,
 we've essentially introduced a hyperbolic manifold that is homomorphic
 to the real-number line.
 The existance of this hyperbolic manifold and its negative curvature esentially
 'explains' why trajectories of iterated functions have positve Lyapunov
 exponents.
 Of course they do, since thier 'true' trajectories should be consideed
 to live on the hyperbolic manifold rather than on the real-number line.
 We try to make this clear below.
 
\layout Standard

One can get a much better sense of the hyperbolic nature induced by this
 symmetry group by looking at the discrete 'rotations' of the binary tree.
 Rotations are frequently used in computer science algorithms to rebalance
 finite binary trees while at the same time preserving the order of the
 elements in the tree.
 We can think of a rotation as kind of like draping the flexible, droopy
 tree over a peg, letting gravity do its job, and declaring the node on
 the peg as the new root of the tree.
 In fact, we have to do a bit of minor surgery to get this right; we ave
 to cut a branch and re-attach it at the free spot where the old root used
 to be.
 
\layout Standard

Thus for example, lets rotate the dyadic tree so that the node at 1/4 becomes
 the new root.
 We do this by chopping off the tree rooted at 3/8'ths and re-attaching
 at as the left subtree of the old root at 1/2.
 (xxx we desperately need a diagram here) Denoting this rotation with the
 symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

, we have an isomorphism of trees: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{4}\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)=\frac{1}{8}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\theta\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)=\frac{1}{16}\;\;\;\;\;\theta\left(\frac{3}{8}\right)=\frac{3}{16}\;\;\;\;\;\theta\left(\frac{5}{8}\right)=\frac{3}{8}\;\;\;\;\;\theta\left(\frac{7}{8}\right)=\frac{3}{4}\]

\end_inset 

 and the rest of the tree hanging as normal under these nodes.
 Its not hard to see that this rotation is order-preserving, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(x)<\theta(y)$
\end_inset 

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $x<y$
\end_inset 

 and ths monotonic, one-to-one and onto.
 This is the strecth-and-shrink map
\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
x/2 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 0\leq x\leq1/2\\
x-1/4 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 1/2\leq x\leq3/4\\
2x-1 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 3/4\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset 

 which is stretching in one interval and shrinking in another.
 Since we've seen that the Modular Group maps intervals to intervals, some
 stretching and some shrinking, we immediately recognize that three group
 elements were used to construct this map.
 Since we've already enumerated the modular group in terms of maps of intervals,
 we see that the three different group elements making up this map are the
 one that re-parented the 1/8 tree at 1/4, the 3/8 tree at 5/8 and the 3/4
 tree at 7/8.
 In terms of tree surgery, it is enough to specify these three remapings,
 as the rest of the binary trees hanging below are structurally unaltered.
 Note that the 3/8'ths to 5/8'ths mapping does not change the denominator:
 this map neither stretches nor shrinks, its a lateral translation.
 
\layout Standard

Note that the map is clearly invertible, with its inverse being 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta^{-1}(x)=xxx\]

\end_inset 

 Notice that the shrinking portion of the map is just the inverse of the
 stretching portion of the map.
 Iterating these maps just makes them even more hyperbolic.

 Note that these maps are symmetric around the

 line, and that the endpoints of each segment lie on the hyperbola 
\begin_inset Formula $xy=2^{-n-2}$
\end_inset 

, with the exception of the endpoints at 0 and 1.
 Since each map contains more segments, each map becomes a better approximation
 to the hyperbola.

\end_inset 

 .
 
\layout Standard

We demonstate a more complex mapping by rebalancing the binary tree so that
 the 3/8 node becomes root.
 This requires two tree movements: switching the 7/16 node so that it lives
 under 1/2, and switching the 5/16 node so that it lives under the now empty
 slot at 1/4.
 This is shown in the diagram (xxx need to create the pretty-picture of
 the rotated tree xxx).
 This rotation is given by the mapping 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\eta(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
x & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 0\leq x\leq1/4\\
x/2+1/8 & \;\textrm{ for \;} & 1/4\leq x\leq3/4\\

Looking at these, it becomes clear that one can insert hyperbolas wherever
 one wishes, as long as the resulting map is monotonically increasing.
 
\layout Standard

And so we can see the negative curvature.
 we also have an explicit metric on this space.
 Note that this in turn induces a metric on the Stern-Brocot Tree.
 We can consider the path of 'geodesics' under this map, say of iterating
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

over and over.
 clearly these 'geodesics' separate.
\layout Standard

Note that this is essentially a model of two-dimensional space-time, where
 the Lorentz transformations are given by elements of the modular group.
\layout Standard

We of course are now begging to ask about 3+1 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 generated by the complex numbers, (xxx this is actually called the Picard
 group see Fricke and Klien, circa 1897.) which is generated by 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,ZxZ)$
\end_inset 

 which is a subgroup of 
\begin_inset Formula $GL(2,C)$
\end_inset 

.
 Studying how rotations work on this manifold would be interesting, as well
 as defining precisely its relation to minkowski spacetime.xxx move this
 to the todo-list.
 Higher dimensional manfolds seem to be generated by quaternions and the
 octonians.
 We also can't help but take a general pot-shot and exclaim 'of course quantum
 mechanics is chaotic: Hamiltonian evolution takes place on a fundamentally
 hyperbolic manifold, viz.
 the Minkowski spacetime'.
 The wave functions will of course be fractal.
 In some freaky way, this is also why we get quantization: we don't truly
 have the general symmetries, we have instead interval-mapping symmetries
 that are limited to a discrete (but infinite) set of intervals.

\layout Standard

Note that the correspondances presented here induce fractal isomorphisms
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset 

 onto itself.
 This was already hinted at in the previous section, where we were trying
 to just plain-old count the rationals, and not getting what every middle
 and high-school teacher teaches students to expect.
 This symmetry would also imply a symmetry on the closure in reals 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

.
 Exactly what it implies for the non-Archimedean closures 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$
\end_inset 

 is not yet clear to me.
 This symmetry is never made use of in classical analysis.
 
\layout Standard

The field structure of the rationals in turn induces a field structure on
 a certain subroup of the modular group, specfically, the interval-mapping
 subgroup.
 Albeit this would be a highly fractal structure ...
 I have no clue of what this field structure implies for modular forms or
 goodies like the Wierstrass elliptic integrals, etc.
 This would be a great TBD with a whole-lotta partyin goin on.

Distributions of Rational Numbers
\layout Standard

Blah Blah, we go back to do some fundamentals.
 The idea is to start exploring the tools we can use to relate the real
 numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 to both 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{C}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

.
 We've already seen that the measure of the distribution of dyadic numbers
 on the real-number line has something funny going on.
 Here, we'll look at the distribution of the Farey numbers on the (dyadic-measur
e) real-number line.
 We'll promptly see that this distribution is the first derivative of the
 Minkowski Question Mark, which is perhaps not surprising if we think of
 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset 

 as the map 
\begin_inset Formula $?:\mathbb{R}_{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{D}$
\end_inset 

 and thus the distribution is the Jacobean of this map.

Distribution of Rationals in the Farey Tree
\layout Standard

One way to enumerate all of the rationals is by placing them on the Farey
 Tree (or the Stern-Brocot Tree).
 One can prove that the Farey Tree enumerates all of the rationals in the
 unit interval exactly once (Proof at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \htmlurl[Cut-the-Knot]{http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Stern.shtml}

\end_inset 

).
 However, the distribution of the rationals on the Farey Tree is highly
 non-uniform, if we walk that tree breadth-first.
 The graph below shows that distribution.
\layout Standard

Superficially, the shape of this curve seems independent of the bining;
 although, upon very close inspection, one can see that is not quite true.
 In particular, one can deduce that in the limit of an 'infinite' number
 of bins, that this 'curve' is equal to exactly zero at every rational 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

, and infinite at every irrational.
 But no matter; for a finite number of bins, we can proceed.
\layout Standard

This shape is remarkably suggestive.
 It appears to be the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $?'(x)=d?(x)/dx$
\end_inset 

 of the continued fraction mapping, although using classical analytic techniques
, this derivative is not definable.
 Indeed, performing a simple numeric integral of the above, and comparing
 it to the exact expression shows a perfect match, as witnessed in the graph
 below.
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename farey-integral.png

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The continued fraction mapping is infinitely differentiable on every rational,
 and all derivatives vanish at every rational; yet the mapping is strictly
 montonically increasing.
 Just examing the graph visually suggests that the derivatives must be non-zero
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

somewhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, although its hard to define how to value these derivatives.
 Yet, visually comparing the Farey mapping to the distribution of the Farey
 Fractions, it seems that the distribution of Farey's might be a good estimate
 of that first derivative.
 Clearly, classical analytic techniques are sorely lacking and inapplicable;
 we need to find a set of tools where we can talk about and manipulate the
 so-called 'first derivative' in a meaningful way.
\layout Standard

Below is another curious picture, where we've relabelled the x axis by passing
 it through

This function appears to vanish only at the dyadics.
 Note the superficial resemblance of the profile to the Takagi curve.
 By visually comparing this function and the Takagi curve (also called the
 
\emph on 
blancmange curve
\emph default 
), one can intuitively sense that there must be some tangent-space-to-Exp-space
 type relation between the two.
 The trick is to write down this relation.
 
\layout Standard

This is really a very curious circumstance.
 The above graphs show only the distribution of a finite number of points
 (they were, after all, computer generated).
 A finite set of points on the real number line is zero; yet we are using
 it to induce a measure that can be used for integration.
 How is this? The statistical properties of a finite sampling provide us
 with information about the limit.
 Its as if we were working with an anti-Cantor-set construction: we start
 with a dust, and average over intervals to discover analytic properties.
