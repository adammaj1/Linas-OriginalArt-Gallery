Intro
\layout Standard

THIS IS A DRAFT WORK IN PROGRESS.
 The intro hasn't been written yet, but if it was, it would work like this:
 Modular forms are analytic functions that are closely related to elliptic
 functions, and have a particular kind of modular group symmetry.
 Modular forms are defined on the upper-half plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset 

 of the complex plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset 

, that is, for complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=x+iy$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $y>0$
\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Apo90}

\end_inset 

.
 Here, we are concerned with the limiting behavior of 
\begin_inset Formula $y\rightarrow0$
\end_inset 

, which yields highly singular functions defined on the real number line,
 yet inheriting a modular group symmetry of the form of which they are the
 limit.
\layout Standard

Most fractals presented in the popular literature have a form that suggests
 that they live on the closure of the hyperbolic plane: that is, they live
 on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

edge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 of that plane.
 Of course, the hyperbolic metric never allows you to get to that edge,
 but one can also put an ordinary Euclidean metric on the Poincare disk,
 or the Poincare upper half plane, and get to that boundary.
 The problem is, of course, that the topologies that seem to suggest themselves
 in these two cases are subtly incompatible, and lead to a variety of confusions.
 In particular, we argue below that when considering the limiting behavior
 of of functions at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

edge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 of hyperbolic space, the correct topology is a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

binary tree topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, similar in form to the Cantor set, but a bit richer.
 In particular, this topology is finer than the usual topology on the real
 number line, and this additional fineness allows otherwise dubious expressions
 to be given precise meaning.
 It is only when functions on this topology are mapped back onto the real
 number line that confusions result.
\layout Section

Distribution of the Rational numbers in the Farey tree
\layout Standard

One way to enumerate all of the rationals is by placing them on the Farey
 tree (or the Stern-Brocot tree).
 It can be shown that the Farey tree enumerates all of the rationals in
 the unit interval exactly once
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Bog96}

\end_inset 

.
 However, the distribution of the rationals on the Farey tree is highly
 non-uniform, ifthe tree is walked breadth-first.
 The figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Distribution-of-Farey}

\end_inset 

 shows that distribution.
 This distribution is highly non-uniform, and by fooling with the number
 of bins in the histogram, it becomes clear that the figure is highly discontinu
ous.
 As the number of bins is increased, it becomes clear that the distribution
 has a peculiar structure: it always has a humped form, even though the
 individual spikes vary strongly according to the number of bins.

Distribution of Farey Fractions
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This figure shows a histogram of the first M=65536 Farey fractions according
 to their location on the unit interval.
 To create this figure, the unit interval is divided up into N=600 bins,
 and the bin count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset 

 for each bin 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 is incremented whenever a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

 falls within the bin: 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-1)/N\leq p/q<n/N$
\end_inset 

.
 At the end of binning, the count is normalized by multiplying each bin
 count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset 

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $N/M$
\end_inset 

.
 The normalization ensures that the histogram is of measure one on the unit
 interval: that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=0}^{N}c_{n}=1$
\end_inset 

.
 In a certain sense, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

shape
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 of this histogram is independent of the number of bins and number of fractions
 counted, although on a highly detailed level, the graph clearly varies
 with the number of bins 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

.
 In a proper formal treatment, we would need to show that the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{M\rightarrow\infty}c_{n}$
\end_inset 

 exists and is finite, for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

.
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The shape is suggestive, and the numerical evidence makes it clear that
 it is somehow the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

derivative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 of the Minkowski question mark function 
\begin_inset Formula $?'(x)=d?(x)/dx$
\end_inset 

.
 Performing a simple numeric integral of the above, and comparing it to
 the exact expression shows a perfect match, as witnessed in the figure
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Sum-of-Farey}

Sum of Farey Histogram

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This figure shows the sum of the bin counts of the Farey fractions, together
 with a graph of the Minkowski question mark function.
 The two graphs can hardly be told apart.
 
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The derivative of the Minkowski question mark function cannot be defined
 using the classical analytic techniques.
 More precisely, traditional analytic tools applied to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 topology of open sets on the real number line are insufficient to construct
 and describe the shape of this curve.
 This motivates the study of alternative topologies for the real number
 line, which constitutes one of the research programs of this paper.
\layout Standard

When one does attempt to use classical techniques applied to the classical
 topology, the result is a number of perposterous-sounding statements, a
 sampling of which are given below.
 The question mark is highly singular.
 It is infinitely differentiable at every rational, and all derivatives
 vanish at every rational; yet the mapping is strictly monotonically increasing.
 Just examining the graph visually suggests that the derivatives must be
 non-zero 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

somewhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, although how to define how to value these derivatives is utterly unclear.
 Naively, they seem to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

infinite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 at every irrational; but this fails to explain how to integrate.
 
\layout Standard

Clearly, the classical approach is sorely lacking and inapplicable; something
 different is needed.
 Two possibilities arise: throw away traditional ideas of integration and
 differentiation, and replace them with something new, something sutiable
 for fractals, or keep these tools, but throw away the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 topology on the real number line.
 The latter approach seems to be far more promising.
 There are several popssible alternative topologies.
 Most immediately obvious is the topology of the Cantor set, which is readily
 mapped to the real number line.
 (discussed elsewhere in this cycle of papers).
 Less obvious, but more appropriate, is the topology of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

cylinder sets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 that is the natural topology for studying shifts, symbolic dynamics, and
 one-dimensional lattice models (discussed later).
\layout Standard

The figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Jacobian}

\end_inset 

 shows what could be called the Jacobian 
\begin_inset Formula $(?'\circ?^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset 

 of the question mark function.
 This figure simple relabels the x-axis by passing it through 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 This function appears to vanish only at the dyadics.
 Note the superficial resemblance of the profile to the Takagi curve.
 By visually comparing this function and the Takagi curve (also called the
 
\emph on 
blancmange curve
\emph default 
), one can intuitively sense that there must be a more formal relation between
 the two, as if the values of the one function could somehow be exponentiated
 to give the other.
 The trick is to write down this relation.

This figure shows the same Farey fraction distribution as in a previous
 figure, except that the x-axis is relabelled by passing it through the
 Minkowski question mark.
 In a certain sense, this can be taken to be the Jacobian 
\begin_inset Formula $(?'\circ?^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset 

 of the question mark.
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This is really a very curious circumstance.
 The above graphs show only the distribution of a finite number of points
 (they were, after all, computer generated).
 A finite set of points on the real number line is zero; yet we are using
 it to induce a measure that can be used for integration.
 How is this? The statistical properties of a finite sampling provide us
 with information about the limit.
 Its as if we were working with an anti-Cantor-set construction: we start
 with a dust, and average over intervals to discover analytic properties.

\begin_inset Formula $w=0.618$

 Note the curious visual resemblance to the Jacobian of the Question mark

 The Takagi curve, explored in another chapter, is given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
t_{w}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}w^{k}\tau\left(2^{k}x\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

 The fractal symmetries of the Takagi curve are given by a three-dimensional
 representation of a sub semi-group of the modular group (see other chapter).
\end_inset 


\layout Subsection

Notes 
\layout Standard

Some slightly formal but not very fruitful remarks follow.
 To prove that the measure vanishes on rationals, one must show two things:
 first, that the measure vanishes near 0 (or 1), in that the the bin count
 for bin 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}$
\end_inset 

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset 

 and a few neighbors) is always bounded above by 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{-\alpha}$
\end_inset 

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>1$
\end_inset 

.
 In fact, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 is probably quite large, and the bound can be made very strong.
 Next, one needs to show a modular group symmetry for the histogram: thus
 for example, that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{pN/q}$
\end_inset 

 obeys a similar bound, but de-rated by a factor given by the modular group
 element that carries 
\begin_inset Formula $0/1$
\end_inset 

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Section

Modular Forms
\layout Standard

A meromorphic function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\tau)$
\end_inset 

 is said to be a modular form of weight 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

 if it has the modular group symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
f\left(\frac{a\tau+b}{c\tau+d}\right)=\left(c\tau+d\right)^{k}f\left(\tau\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $ad-bc=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 is a complex number, restricted to the upper-half plane: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Im\tau>0$
\end_inset 

.
 Modular forms can also be expressed as a function of the nome 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\exp i\pi\tau$
\end_inset 

.
 In this form, many have the interesting property of having poles and zeros
 closely interspersed at the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|\rightarrow1$
\end_inset 

, with poles (or zeros) occurring at rational angles, and the other at irrationa
l angles.
 A particular example of this is the twenty-fourth root of the modular discrimin
ant, known as the Dedekind eta.

\layout Standard

This figure shows a particular slice through the Dedekind eta function 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=q^{1/24}\Pi_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{2n})$
\end_inset 

.
 This figure graphs 
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta|$
\end_inset 

 along a particular curve: we take 
\begin_inset Formula $q=|q|e^{i\theta}$
\end_inset 

 and hold 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|=0.96$
\end_inset 

 fixed, while sweeping through values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

 from 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset 

.
 Several features of this figure should be noted.
 First, this function is continuous and infinitely differentiable for any
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|<1$
\end_inset 

.
 Next, the Dedekind eta has a kind of modular group symmetry: if we write
 the nome 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\exp(i\pi\tau)$
\end_inset 

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta((a\tau+b)/(c\tau+d))|=|\sqrt{c\tau+d}\;\eta(\tau)|$
\end_inset 

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset 

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $ad-bc=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Finally, in the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|\rightarrow1$
\end_inset 

, this function has a zero for all rational angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\pi m/n$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 are integers, but otherwise this function diverges for all non-rational
 angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

.
 As such, it has a superficial resemblance to 
\begin_inset Formula $d?(x)/dx$
\end_inset 

.
 
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Dedekind-Eta}

\end_inset 

 shows a particular cross-section through the Dedekind eta.
 Note the suggestive shape of this curve, and how it crudely resembles the
 distribution of the Farey fractions.
 Although it is clear that this curve will not converge to the derivative
 of the question mark in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|\rightarrow1$
\end_inset 

, it none-the-less is suggestive.
 Notably, modular forms already have the modular group symmetry, and so
 already have the symmetry properties of the final curve that we are searching
 for.
 This is unlike the histograming approach, where the symmetry is obtained
 only in the limit.
 The other remarkable property is that modular forms are infinitely differentiab
le, and thus posses well-behaved analytic properties, again allowing a kind
 of study that is ill-afforded by the histograms.

The presumption made here is that the derivative of the Minkowski question
 mark function will be found to be the limit of some modular form, although
 which modular form that might be is not clear.
 The theory of modular forms is deep and broad, and will not be reviewed
 here.
 A very synoptic overview can be found in the article on elliptic functions

A Binary Tree Topology

This section added in dec 2005, and was conceived in the summer of 2005.
 This section should be split out into its own doc eventually, and dated
 to the summer of 2005.

\layout Standard

Consider the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

dyadic topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

: every rational of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $p/2^{n}$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

 odd and integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n>0$
\end_inset 

 is taken to be an open set.
 All points in between such dyadic rationals are taken to form an open set.
\layout Standard

One way to visualize this topology is as a binary tree.
 At the root of the tree is the point 1/2.
 At the next level, there is 1/4 and 3/4, and so on.
 Every such node in the tree is then taken to be an open set.
 At the leafs of the tree lie the irrationals, and the rationals not of
 the form 
\begin_inset Formula $p/2^{n}$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The topology differs from that of the canonical Cantor set: in that case,
 the intermediate nodes are not even considered to be a part of the topology.
 The leaf nodes are taken to be closed sets, which is how the Cantor set
 becomes a perfect set.
\layout Standard

The point of introducing this binary tree topology is ....
 Task: construct measures on this topology.
\layout Standard

Several remarks are in order.
 First, in the canonical Cantor set, each leaf was assigned a measure of
 zero.
 It should be clear that this choice is arbitrary, and that any measure
 can be assigned to the endpoints.
 The cardinality of the endpoints of the binary tree is the cardinality
 of the continuum, as can be seen by using more or less the same arguments
 used to discuss the cardinality of the Cantor set.
 Because of this, it is not unreasonable to believe that one may be able
 to construct measures that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

make sense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the context of the real number line.
 In particular, such measures can make well-defined integrals and the like.
\layout Standard

Of interest are measures that are functions of, and possibly holomorphic
 functions, of the dyadic expansion.
 That is, consider the series 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ b_{k}:b_{k}\in\{0,1\},\, k\in\mathbb{N}\}$
\end_inset 

of binary digits given by the dyadic expansion of a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{k}}{2^{k}}\label{eq: binary expansion}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This expansion is not unique, because for every dyadic number, there are
 two inequivalent expansions.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2=0.1000..=0.0111...$
\end_inset 

.
 Therefore, we conclude that the dyadic topology is finer than the the usual
 topology on the real numbers.
 In particular, the dyadic topology distinguishes all three of these cases:
 1/2 is a not in the middle of the tree (the root as it happens here), whereas
 the two inequivalent expansions belong to two different leafs at the end
 of the binary tree.
\layout Standard

Because this topology is finer than the usual topology on the real number
 line, one can define functions on this topology that would be ill-defined
 when considered on the real number line: in particular, the three points
 above map to just one point on the real numbers.
 However, it should be painfully clear at this point that this topology
 is compatible with the discussion the structure of dyadic fractals.
 It should also be clear that this topology is compatible with discussions
 of the closure of the upper half-plane when considering the limiting behavior
 of modular forms, Fuchsian groups, and ergodic processes.
\layout Standard

As an example, consider the Takagi curve.
 When considered on the real-number line, it has a derivative that seems
 to be defined nowhere.
 When considered on the binary tree topology, its derivative looks a lot
 less intimidating: in fact, it is perfectly well-defined on the leaves;
 the only ambiguity is on the interior nodes of the tree.
 Furthermore, the interior nodes of the tree are a countable set, whereas
 the leaves are uncountable.
 
\layout Standard

XXX Discuss 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

fat cantor set
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, i.e.
 a measure which puts all of the measure on the leaves ot the tree.
 
\layout Standard

This implies that the derivative of the Takagi curve is in fact defined
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

almost everywhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, with the exception of only a countable set of points.
 The goal here is to bootstrap this realization into providing a wholesome
 topological definition for all fractal measures.
\layout Standard

Next, because the topology is that of a binary tree, it should be clear
 that any binary structure inherits this topology in a natural way.
 In particular, the Stern-Brocot tree has this topology.
 In particular, this means that there is a second natural mapping to the
 real number line, given by the Minkowski Question Mark function.
 The interior nodes of the tree are the rational numbers (a countable set),
 and the leaves of the tree are the irrationals (of the cardinality of the
 continuum).
 By using the dyadic topology, the derivative of the question mark function
 becomes a whole lot less intimidating as well: it becomes clear that the
 derivative is precisely zero on the rationals (the interior nodes of the
 tree), and non-zero on the leaves.
 Again, because of the cardinality of the leaves, it becomes clear that
 this measure can be integrated in a well-founded way.
 The problem then is no longer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

how can the derivative of the question mark be put on a good foundation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, rather it becomes

XXXX ToDo: review standard topological notions for the binary tree topology
 in greater detail, such as separation axioms, bases, metrics, continuity,
 differentiability.
 etc.
 Note that finer topologies typically have fewer continuous, smooth functions
 than coarse topologies.
 Since this is finer than the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
