\begin_layout Abstract
A notable example of a discontinuouis-everywhere function that is not traditiona
lly integrable, yet, when properly defined, can be integrated, is derivative
 of the Minkowski question mark function.
 It, and its generalizations are known as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

multi-fractal measures
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Thus, this paper explores what it means to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

take the derivative of the question mark function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 As a side-effect, all of the various functions that occur have a particular
 fractal self-symmetry, which can be made explicitly manifest; it is the
 symmetry of the dyadic monoid, that is, the period-doubling subset of the
 modular group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$

\begin_layout Section
Distribution of the Rational numbers in the Farey tree
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to enumerate all of the rationals is by placing them on the Farey
 tree (or the Stern-Brocot tree).
 It can be shown that the Farey tree enumerates all of the rationals in
 the unit interval exactly once
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Bog96"

\end_inset

.
 However, the distribution of the rationals on the Farey tree is highly
 non-uniform, if the tree is walked breadth-first.
 The figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:Distribution-of-Farey"

\end_inset

 shows that distribution.
 This distribution is highly non-uniform, and by fooling with the number
 of bins in the histogram, it becomes clear that the figure is highly discontinu
ous.
 As the number of bins is increased, it becomes clear that the distribution
 has a peculiar structure: it always has a humped form, even though the
 individual spikes vary strongly according to the number of bins.

This figure shows a histogram of the first M=65536 Farey fractions according
 to their location on the unit interval.
 To create this figure, the unit interval is divided up into N=600 bins,
 and the bin count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset

 for each bin 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is incremented whenever a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 falls within the bin: 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-1)/N\leq p/q<n/N$
\end_inset

.
 At the end of binning, the count is normalized by multiplying each bin
 count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $N/M$
\end_inset

.
 The normalization ensures that the histogram is of measure one on the unit
 interval: that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=0}^{N}c_{n}=1$
\end_inset

.
 In a certain sense, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

shape
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of this histogram is independent of the number of bins and number of fractions
 counted, although on a highly detailed level, the graph clearly varies
 with the number of bins 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 In a proper formal treatment, we would need to show that the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{M\rightarrow\infty}c_{n}$
\end_inset

 exists and is finite, for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

\begin_layout Standard
The derivative of the Minkowski question mark function cannot be defined
 using the classical analytic techniques.
 More precisely, traditional analytic tools applied to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 topology of open sets on the real number line are insufficient to construct
 and describe the shape of this curve.
 This motivates the study of alternative topologies for the real number
 line, which constitutes one of the research programs of this paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When one does attempt to use classical techniques applied to the classical
 topology, the result is a number of perposterous-sounding statements, a
 sampling of which are given below.
 The question mark is highly singular.
 It is infinitely differentiable at every rational, and all derivatives
 vanish at every rational; yet the mapping is strictly monotonically increasing.
 Just examining the graph visually suggests that the derivatives must be
 non-zero 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

somewhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, although how to define how to value these derivatives is utterly unclear.
 Naively, they seem to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at every irrational; but this fails to explain how to integrate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, the classical approach is sorely lacking and inapplicable; something
 different is needed.
 Two possibilities arise: throw away traditional ideas of integration and
 differentiation, and replace them with something new, something sutiable
 for fractals, or keep these tools, but throw away the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 topology on the real number line.
 The latter approach seems to be far more promising.
 There are several popssible alternative topologies.
 Most immediately obvious is the topology of the Cantor set, which is readily
 mapped to the real number line.
 (discussed elsewhere in this cycle of papers).
 Less obvious, but more appropriate, is the topology of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cylinder sets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that is the natural topology for studying shifts, symbolic dynamics, and
 one-dimensional lattice models (discussed later).

The figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

 shows what could be called the Jacobian 
\begin_inset Formula $(?'\circ?^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset

 of the question mark function.
 This figure simple relabels the x-axis by passing it through 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset

.
 This function appears to vanish only at the dyadics.
 Note the superficial resemblance of the profile to the Takagi curve.
 By visually comparing this function and the Takagi curve (also called the
 
\emph on
blancmange curve
\emph default
), one can intuitively sense that there must be a more formal relation between
 the two, as if the values of the one function could somehow be exponentiated
 to give the other.
 The trick is to write down this relation.

This is really a very curious circumstance.
 The above graphs show only the distribution of a finite number of points
 (they were, after all, computer generated).
 A finite set of points on the real number line is zero; yet we are using
 it to induce a measure that can be used for integration.
 How is this? The statistical properties of a finite sampling provide us
 with information about the limit.
 Its as if we were working with an anti-Cantor-set construction: we start
 with a dust, and average over intervals to discover analytic properties.

Notes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some slightly formal but not very fruitful remarks follow.
 To prove that the measure vanishes on rationals, one must show two things:
 first, that the measure vanishes near 0 (or 1), in that the the bin count
 for bin 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}$
\end_inset

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

 and a few neighbors) is always bounded above by 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{-\alpha}$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>1$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is probably quite large, and the bound can be made very strong.
 Next, one needs to show a modular group symmetry for the histogram: thus
 for example, that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{pN/q}$
\end_inset

 obeys a similar bound, but de-rated by a factor given by the modular group
 element that carries 
\begin_inset Formula $0/1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

.

Jacobian and its Fourier transform

Consider the integral 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b_{n}=\int_{0}^{1}\exp\left(2\pi inx\right)\frac{dx}{?^{\prime}\left(?^{-1}\left(x\right)\right)}\]

\end_inset

Because the denominator is discontinuous everywhere, the above is not well-defin
ed without additional work.
 Noting the denominator is in the form of a Jacobian, naively performing
 the change of variable 
\begin_inset Formula $u=?^{-1}(x)$
\end_inset

 leads to 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
b_{n}=\int_{0}^{1}\exp\left(2\pi in?\left(u\right)\right)du\label{eq:fourier coffs}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This last expression is easily evaluated by numerical means.
 By symmetry of the question-mark function, the coefficients are purely
 real.
 A graph of these coefficients are shown in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Fourier-of-Jacobian"

 A fractal self-similarity is clearly evident.

Modular forms are analytic functions that are closely related to elliptic
 functions, and have a particular kind of modular group symmetry.
 Modular forms are defined on the upper-half plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset

 of the complex plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

, that is, for complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=x+iy$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $y>0$
\end_inset


\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Apo90"

\end_inset

.
 Here, we are concerned with the limiting behavior of 
\begin_inset Formula $y\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, which yields highly singular functions defined on the real number line,
 yet inheriting a modular group symmetry of the form of which they are the
 limit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most fractals presented in the popular literature have a form that suggests
 that they live on the closure of the hyperbolic plane: that is, they live
 on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

edge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of that plane.
 Of course, the hyperbolic metric never allows you to get to that edge,
 but one can also put an ordinary Euclidean metric on the Poincare disk,
 or the Poincare upper half plane, and get to that boundary.
 The problem is, of course, that the topologies that seem to suggest themselves
 in these two cases are subtly incompatible, and lead to a variety of confusions.
 In particular, we argue below that when considering the limiting behavior
 of of functions at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

edge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of hyperbolic space, the correct topology is a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

binary tree topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, similar in form to the Cantor set, but a bit richer.
 In particular, this topology is finer than the usual topology on the real
 number line, and this additional fineness allows otherwise dubious expressions
 to be given precise meaning.
 It is only when functions on this topology are mapped back onto the real
 number line that confusions result.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

dyadic topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: every rational of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $p/2^{n}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 odd and integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n>0$
\end_inset

 is taken to be an open set.
 All points in between such dyadic rationals are taken to form an open set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to visualize this topology is as a binary tree.
 At the root of the tree is the point 1/2.
 At the next level, there is 1/4 and 3/4, and so on.
 Every such node in the tree is then taken to be an open set.
 At the leafs of the tree lie the irrationals, and the rationals not of
 the form 
\begin_inset Formula $p/2^{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The topology differs from that of the canonical Cantor set: in that case,
 the intermediate nodes are not even considered to be a part of the topology.
 The leaf nodes are taken to be closed sets, which is how the Cantor set
 becomes a perfect set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point of introducing this binary tree topology is ....
 Task: construct measures on this topology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several remarks are in order.
 First, in the canonical Cantor set, each leaf was assigned a measure of
 zero.
 It should be clear that this choice is arbitrary, and that any measure
 can be assigned to the endpoints.
 The cardinality of the endpoints of the binary tree is the cardinality
 of the continuum, as can be seen by using more or less the same arguments
 used to discuss the cardinality of the Cantor set.
 Because of this, it is not unreasonable to believe that one may be able
 to construct measures that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

make sense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the context of the real number line.
 In particular, such measures can make well-defined integrals and the like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of interest are measures that are functions of, and possibly holomorphic
 functions, of the dyadic expansion.
 That is, consider the series 
\begin_inset Formula $\{b_{k}:b_{k}\in\{0,1\},\, k\in\mathbb{N}\}$
\end_inset

of binary digits given by the dyadic expansion of a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{k}}{2^{k}}\label{eq: binary expansion}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This expansion is not unique, because for every dyadic number, there are
 two inequivalent expansions.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2=0.1000..=0.0111...$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, we conclude that the dyadic topology is finer than the the usual
 topology on the real numbers.
 In particular, the dyadic topology distinguishes all three of these cases:
 1/2 is a not in the middle of the tree (the root as it happens here), whereas
 the two inequivalent expansions belong to two different leafs at the end
 of the binary tree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because this topology is finer than the usual topology on the real number
 line, one can define functions on this topology that would be ill-defined
 when considered on the real number line: in particular, the three points
 above map to just one point on the real numbers.
 However, it should be painfully clear at this point that this topology
 is compatible with the discussion the structure of dyadic fractals.
 It should also be clear that this topology is compatible with discussions
 of the closure of the upper half-plane when considering the limiting behavior
 of modular forms, Fuchsian groups, and ergodic processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example, consider the Takagi curve.
 When considered on the real-number line, it has a derivative that seems
 to be defined nowhere.
 When considered on the binary tree topology, its derivative looks a lot
 less intimidating: in fact, it is perfectly well-defined on the leaves;
 the only ambiguity is on the interior nodes of the tree.
 Furthermore, the interior nodes of the tree are a countable set, whereas
 the leaves are uncountable.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that the derivative of the Takagi curve is in fact defined
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

almost everywhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with the exception of only a countable set of points.
 The goal here is to bootstrap this realization into providing a wholesome
 topological definition for all fractal measures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, because the topology is that of a binary tree, it should be clear
 that any binary structure inherits this topology in a natural way.
 In particular, the Stern-Brocot tree has this topology.
 In particular, this means that there is a second natural mapping to the
 real number line, given by the Minkowski Question Mark function.
 The interior nodes of the tree are the rational numbers (a countable set),
 and the leaves of the tree are the irrationals (of the cardinality of the
 continuum).
 By using the dyadic topology, the derivative of the question mark function
 becomes a whole lot less intimidating as well: it becomes clear that the
 derivative is precisely zero on the rationals (the interior nodes of the
 tree), and non-zero on the leaves.
 Again, because of the cardinality of the leaves, it becomes clear that
 this measure can be integrated in a well-founded way.
 The problem then is no longer

 differentiability.
 etc.
 Note that finer topologies typically have fewer continuous, smooth functions
 than coarse topologies.
 Since this is finer than the

\begin_layout Standard
A meromorphic function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is said to be a modular form of weight 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 if it has the modular group symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
f\left(\frac{a\tau+b}{c\tau+d}\right)=\left(c\tau+d\right)^{k}f\left(\tau\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $ad-bc=1$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is a complex number, restricted to the upper-half plane: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Im\tau>0$
\end_inset

.
 Modular forms can also be expressed as a function of the nome 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\exp i\pi\tau$
\end_inset

.
 In this form, many have the interesting property of having poles and zeros
 closely interspersed at the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

, with poles (or zeros) occurring at rational angles, and the other at irrationa
l angles.
 A particular example of this is the twenty-fourth root of the modular discrimin
ant, known as the Dedekind eta.

This figure shows a particular slice through the Dedekind eta function 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=q^{1/24}\Pi_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{2n})$
\end_inset

.
 This figure graphs 
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta|$
\end_inset

 along a particular curve: we take 
\begin_inset Formula $q=|q|e^{i\theta}$
\end_inset

 and hold 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|=0.96$
\end_inset

 fixed, while sweeping through values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 from 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 Several features of this figure should be noted.
 First, this function is continuous and infinitely differentiable for any
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|<1$
\end_inset

.
 Next, the Dedekind eta has a kind of modular group symmetry: if we write
 the nome 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\exp(i\pi\tau)$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta((a\tau+b)/(c\tau+d))|=|\sqrt{c\tau+d}\;\eta(\tau)|$
\end_inset

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $ad-bc=1$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, in the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

, this function has a zero for all rational angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\pi m/n$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 are integers, but otherwise this function diverges for all non-rational
 angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 As such, it has a superficial resemblance to 
\begin_inset Formula $d?(x)/dx$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
The figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:Dedekind-Eta"

\end_inset

 shows a particular cross-section through the Dedekind eta.
 Note the suggestive shape of this curve, and how it crudely resembles the
 distribution of the Farey fractions.
 Although it is clear that this curve will not converge to the derivative
 of the question mark in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

, it none-the-less is suggestive.
 Notably, modular forms already have the modular group symmetry, and so
 already have the symmetry properties of the final curve that we are searching
 for.
 This is unlike the histograming approach, where the symmetry is obtained
 only in the limit.
 The other remarkable property is that modular forms are infinitely differentiab
le, and thus posses well-behaved analytic properties, again allowing a kind
 of study that is ill-afforded by the histograms.

This figure shows an angular cross section of a series build from the number-the
oretic divisor function.
 Specifically, it is a graph of
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sigma_{2}(n)r^{n}e^{in\theta}\right|^{-1}\]

\end_inset

 for a fixed value of r=0.95 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 running from 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 Each tall spike represents a close approach to a zero of the divisor series.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{2}(n)$
\end_inset

 is an arithmetic series, specifically, the multiplicative series 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sigma_{a}(n)=\sum_{d|n}d^{a}\]

\end_inset

 where the sum extends over the integer divisors of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

The presumption made here is that the derivative of the Minkowski question
 mark function will be found to be the limit of some modular form, although
 which modular form that might be is not clear.
 The theory of modular forms is deep and broad, and will not be reviewed
 here.
 A very synoptic overview can be found in the article on elliptic functions
 in Wikipedia.
 There are many deep expositions on the topic
