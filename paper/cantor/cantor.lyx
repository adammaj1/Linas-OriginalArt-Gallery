12 October 2004 (updated 31 December 2005)
\layout Abstract

In this breif note, we review the connection between the distribution of
 the Farey fractions on the real number line, and the derivative of the
 Minkowski Question Mark function.
 We point out that the derivivative of the question mark can also be obtained
 as the limiting behaviour of a modular form.
 Modular forms are analytic functions that are closely related to elliptic
 functions, and have a particular kind of modular group symmetry.
 
\layout Abstract

A research diary of results on other measures is presented as well, including
 results on the measures of fat cantor sets of various types.
 A natural topology for exploring these measures is discussed.
\layout Abstract

This paper is part of a set of chapters that explore the relationship between
 the real numbers, the modular group, and fractals.

Intro
\layout Standard

THIS IS A DRAFT WORK IN PROGRESS.
 The intro hasn't been written yet, but if it was, it would work like this:
 Modular forms are analytic functions that are closely related to elliptic
 functions, and have a particular kind of modular group symmetry.
 Modular forms are defined on the upper-half plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset 

 of the complex plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset 

, that is, for complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=x+iy$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $y>0$
\end_inset 

.
 Here, we are concerned with the limiting behaviour of 
\begin_inset Formula $y\rightarrow0$
\end_inset 

, which yeilds highly singular functions defined on the real number line,
 yet inheriting a modular group symmetry of teh form of which they are the
 limit.

Distributions of Rational Numbers
\layout Standard

In a different paper we looked at the distribution of rationals.
 Here we look at the distribution of the Farey fractions.
 These are sometimes called

multifractal measures

Distribution of Rationals in the Farey Tree
\layout Standard

One way to enumerate all of the rationals is by placing them on the Farey
 Tree (or the Stern-Brocot Tree).
 One can prove that the Farey Tree enumerates all of the rationals in the
 unit interval exactly once (Proof at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \htmlurl[Cut-the-Knot]{http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Stern.shtml}

\end_inset 

).
 However, the distribution of the rationals on the Farey Tree is highly
 non-uniform, if we walk that tree breadth-first.
 The figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Distribution-of-Farey}

\end_inset 

 shows that distribution.
 This distribution is highly non-uniform, and by fooling with the number
 of bins in the histogram, it becomes clear that the figure is highly discontinu
ous.
 Remarkably, though, in a certain sense, the figure also stays uniform in
 a certain sense as the number of bins is increased: it always has this
 humped form, even though the individual spikes vary strongly according
 to the number of bins.

Distribution of Farey Fractions
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics

	width 100col%

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This figure shows a histogram of the first M=65536 Farey fractions according
 to thier location on the unit interval.
 To create this figure, the unit interval is divided up into N=600 bins,
 and the bin count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset 

 for each bin 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 is incremented whenever a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

 falls within the bin: 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-1)/N\leq p/q<n/N$
\end_inset 

.
 At the end of binning, the count is normalized by multiplying each bin
 count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset 

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $N/M$
\end_inset 

.
 The normalization ensures that the histogram is of measure one on the unit
 interval: that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=0}^{N}c_{n}=1$
\end_inset 

.
 In a certain sense, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

shape
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 of this historgram is independent of the number of bins and number of fractions
 counted, although on a highly detailed level, the graph clearly varies
 with the number of bins 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

.
 In a proper formal treatment, we would need to show that the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{M\rightarrow\infty}c_{n}$
\end_inset 

 exists and is finite, for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

.
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The other remarkable property of this curve is that in the limit of an 'infinite
' number of bins, this 'curve' is equal to exactly zero at every rational
 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

, and infinite at every irrational.
 
\layout Standard

This shape is remarkably suggestive.
 It appears to be the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $?'(x)=d?(x)/dx$
\end_inset 

 of the continued fraction mapping, although using classical analytic techniques
, this derivative is not definable, as the question mark is highly singular.
 Performing a simple numeric integral of the above, and comparing it to
 the exact expression shows a perfect match, as witnessed in the figure
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Sum-of-Farey}

\end_inset 

.
 The Minkowski question mark is infinitely differentiable on every rational,
 and all derivatives vanish at every rational; yet the mapping is strictly
 montonically increasing.
 Just examing the graph visually suggests that the derivatives must be non-zero
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

somewhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, although its hard to define how to value these derivatives.
 Yet, visually comparing the Farey mapping to the distribution of the Farey
 Fractions, it seems that the distribution of Farey's provides an excellent
 estimate of that first derivative.
 Clearly, classical analytic techniques are sorely lacking and inapplicable;
 we need to find a set of tools where we can talk about and manipulate the
 so-called 'first derivative' in a meaningful way.

 of teh question mark function.
 This figure simple relabels the x-axis by passing it through 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 This function appears to vanish only at the dyadics.
 Note the superficial resemblance of the profile to the Takagi curve.
 By visually comparing this function and the Takagi curve (also called the
 
\emph on 
blancmange curve
\emph default 
), one can intuitively sense that there must be some tangent-space-to-Exp-space
 type relation between the two.
 The trick is to write down this relation.

This figure shows the same Farey fraction distribution as in a previous

 Minkowski question mark.
 In a certain sense, this can be taken to be the Jacobian 
\begin_inset Formula $(?'\circ?^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset 

 of the question mark.
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This is really a very curious circumstance.
 The above graphs show only the distribution of a finite number of points
 (they were, after all, computer generated).
 A finite set of points on the real number line is zero; yet we are using
 it to induce a measure that can be used for integration.
 How is this? The statistical properties of a finite sampling provide us
 with information about the limit.
 Its as if we were working with an anti-Cantor-set construction: we start
 with a dust, and average over intervals to discover analytic properties.

his figure shows an angular cross section of a series build from the number-theo

 Specifically, it is a graph of

\end_inset 

 where the sum extends over the integer divisors of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

\layout Subsection

Formal Treatment
\layout Standard

The previous section provided only a hand-waving intro.
 We need a formal treatment.
 To prove that the measure vanishes on rationals, we need to show two things:
 first, that the measure vanishes near 0 (or 1), in that the the bin count
 for bin 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}$
\end_inset 

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset 

 and a few neighbors) is always bounded above by 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{-\alpha}$
\end_inset 

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>1$
\end_inset 

.
 In fact, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 is probably quite large, and the bound can be made very strong.
 Next, one needs to show a modular group symmetry for the histogram: thus
 for example, that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{pN/q}$
\end_inset 

 obeys a similar bound, but derated by a factor given by the modular group
 element that carries 
\begin_inset Formula $0/1$
\end_inset 

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Subsection

Modular Forms
\layout Standard

A meromorphic function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\tau)$
\end_inset 

 is said to be a modular form of weight 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

 if it has the moduar group symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
f\left(\frac{a\tau+b}{c\tau+d}\right)=\left(c\tau+d\right)^{k}f\left(\tau\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $ad-bc=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 is a complex number, restricted to the upper-half plane: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Im\tau>0$
\end_inset 

.
 Modular forms can also be expressed as a function of the nome 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\exp i\pi\tau$
\end_inset 

.
 In this form, many have the interesting property of having poles and zeros
 closely interspersed at the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|\rightarrow1$
\end_inset 

, with poles (or zeros) occuring at rational angles, and the other at irrational
 angles.
 A particular example of this is the twenty-fourth root of the modular discrimin
ant, known as the Dedekind eta.

This figure shows a particular slice through the Dedekind eta function 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=q^{1/24}\Pi_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{2n})$
\end_inset 

.
 This figure graphs 
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta|$
\end_inset 

 along a particular curve: we take 
\begin_inset Formula $q=|q|e^{i\theta}$
\end_inset 

 and hold 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|=0.96$
\end_inset 

 fixed, while sweeping through values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

 from 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset 

.
 Several features of this figure should be noted.
 First, this function is continuous and infinitely differentiable for any
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|<1$
\end_inset 

.
 Next, the Dedekind eta has a kind of modular group symmetry: if we write
 the nome 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\exp(i\pi\tau)$
\end_inset 

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta((a\tau+b)/(c\tau+d))|=|\sqrt{c\tau+d}\;\eta(\tau)|$
\end_inset 

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset 

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $ad-bc=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Finally, in the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|\rightarrow1$
\end_inset 

, this function has a zero for all rational angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\pi m/n$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 are integers, but otherwise this function diverges for all non-rational
 angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

.
 As such, it has a superficial resemblance to 
\begin_inset Formula $d?(x)/dx$
\end_inset 

.
 
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Dedekind-Eta}

\end_inset 

 shows a particular cross-section through the Dedekind eta.
 Note the suggestive shape of this curve, and how it crudely resembles the
 distribution of the Farey fractions.
 Although it is clear that this curve will not converge to the derivative
 of the question mark in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $|q|\rightarrow1$
\end_inset 

, it none-the-less is suggestive.
 Notably, modular forms already have the modular group symmetry, and so
 already have the symmetry properties of the final curve that we are searching
 for.
 This is unlike the histograming approach, where the symmetry is obtained
 only in the limit.
 The other remarkable property is that modular forms are infinitely differentiab
le, and thus posees well-behaved analytic properties, again allowing a kind
 of studdy that is ill-afforded by the histograms.
\layout Standard

The presumption that we are making here is that the derivative of the Minkowski
 question mark function will be found to be the limit of some modular form,
 although which modular form that might be is not clear at this time.
 The theory of modular forms is deep andbroad, and will not be reviewed
 here; the following assumes a basic understanding.
 A very synoptic overview can be found in the article on elliptic functions
 in Wikipedia.
 An in-depth exposition can be found in the book by Apostol.

A Binary Tree Topology
\layout Standard

Consider the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

dyadic topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

: every rational of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $p/2^{n}$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

 odd and integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n>0$
\end_inset 

 is taken to be an open set.
 All points in between such dyadic rationals are taken to form an open set.
\layout Standard

One way to visualize this topology is as a binary tree.
 At the root of the tree is the point 1/2.
 At the next level, there is 1/4 and 3/4, and so on.
 Every such node in the tree is then taken to be an open set.
 At the leafs of the tree lie the irrationals, and the rationals not of
 the form 
\begin_inset Formula $p/2^{n}$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The topology differs from that of the canonical Cantor set: in that case,
 the intermediate nodes are not even considered to be a part of the topology.
 The leaf nodes are taken to be closed sets, which is how the Cantor set
 becomes a perfect set.
\layout Standard

The point of introducing this binary tree topology is in order to give a
 more precise footing for much of the rest of the discussion.
 In particular, we are interested in constructing measures on this topology.
\layout Standard

Several remarks are in order.
 First, in the canonical Cantor set, each leaf was assigned a measure of
 zero.
 It should be clear that this choice is arbitrary, and that any measure
 can be assigned to the endpoints.
 The cardinality of the endpoints of the binary tree is the cardinality
 of the continuum, as can be seen by using more or less the same arguments
 used to discuss the cardinality of the Cantor set.
 Because of this, it is not unreasonable to beleive that one may be able
 to construct measures that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

make sense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the context of the real number line.
 In particular, such measures can make well-defined integrals and the like.
\layout Standard

In particular, we are interested in measures that are functions of, and
 possibly holomorphic functions of the dyadic expansion.
 That is, consider the series 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ b_{k}:b_{k}\in\{0,1\},\, k\in\mathbb{N}\}$
\end_inset 

of binary digits given by the dyadic expansion of a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{k}}{2^{k}}\label{eq: binary expansion}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This expansion is not unique, because for every dyadic number, there are
 two inequivalent expansions.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2=0.1000..=0.0111...$
\end_inset 

.
 Therefore, we conclude that the dyadic topology is finer than the the usual
 topology on the real numbers.
 In particular, the dyadic topology distinguishes all three of these cases:
 1/2 is a not in the middle of the tree (the root as it happens here), whereas
 the two inequivalent expansions belong to two different leafs at the end
 of the binary tree.
\layout Standard

Because this topology is finer than the usual topology on the real number
 line, we can define functions on this topology that would be ill-defined
 when considered on the real number line: in particular, the three points
 above map to just one point on the real numbers.
 However, it should be painfully clear at this point that this topology
 is the appropriate topology for discussing the structure of fractals.
 It should also be clear that this is the correct topology in which to discuss
 the closure of the upper half-plane when discussion the limiting behaviour
 of modular forms, Fuchsian groups, and ergodic processes.
 
\layout Standard

Next, because the topology is that of a binary tree, it should be clear
 that any binary structure inherits this topology in a natural way.
 In particular, the Stern Brocot Tree has this topology.
\layout Standard

gives a map of the real number line to a subset of the 
\layout Standard

There are a large variety of constructions that can be made from this series;
 for example 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
c_{z}(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}b_{k}z^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Clearly, for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1/2$
\end_inset 

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1/2}(x)=x$
\end_inset 

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1/3$
\end_inset 

, we have essentially the inverse of the classic Cantor function, as show
 in the figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Cantor-Polynomial}

This figure shows a graph of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset 

 for a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1/3$
\end_inset 

.
 This graph provides possibly the easiest visual proof that the cardinality
 of the Cantor Set is equal to the cardinality of the unit interval
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-14}

\end_inset 

, a result which can sometimes be difficult to visualize.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=2c_{1/3}(x)/3$
\end_inset 

 maps the unit interval into the unit interval.
 It is strictly monotonically increasing, and if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\neq y$
\end_inset 

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)\neq f(y)$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, this function is one-to-one, and thus the cardinality of the image
 is equal to the cardinality of the unit interval.
 But the image of this function is just the canonical Cantor set, constructed
 by recursively removing the open middle-third interval.
 The largest 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

middle-third
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset 

; the next two largest correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/4$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x=3/4$
\end_inset 

, and so on: each removed interval corresponds to a rational number, expressed
 as its binary expansion.
 It is not hard to see that that the sum of the lengths of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

middle thirds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 adds up to one, and thus, the measure of the image of this function is
 zero.
 Thus, we have quickly sketched that the cardinality of the Cantor set is
 that of the real numbers, but the measure of the Cantor Set is zero.
 It is not hard to see that one gets a similar result using 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=(1-z)c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset 

 for any value of 
\begin_inset Formula $0<z<1/2$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

There were only two 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

tricky
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 parts to this demonstration.
 One is the assertion that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)\neq f(y)$
\end_inset 

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $x\neq y$
\end_inset 

, but this can be deduced easily enough by contemplating the definition
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 The other trick we slid by here was that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

 is somewhat vaguely defined for the rationals: every rational number 
\begin_inset Formula $x=p/q$
\end_inset 

 has two inequivalent binary expansions.
 For example, x=1/2=0.1000...=0.0111...
 and the first binary expansion yeilds 
\begin_inset Formula $f(1/2)=1/3$
\end_inset 

 while the second yeilds 
\begin_inset Formula $f(1/2)=2/3$
\end_inset 

.
 But this doesn't affect the proof: however we choose to tighten up the
 definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset 

, it is still one-to-one and monotonic, and its image still has the cardinality
 of the unit interval.
 
\end_inset 

 
\layout Standard

The essential point is that every rational number has two possible binary
 expansions: for example, it is well known that 
\begin_inset Formula $1.000..=0.111...$
\end_inset 

 .
 But each such expansion yields two inequivalent Cantor polynomials.
 Cantor's essential insight was that these two inequivalent representations
 of the real numbers by binary sequences can be re-interpreted as the endpoints
 of a set of non-overlapping line segments.
 Converting the binary sequence into a polynomial series in

Note that there is another construction by which one can place gaps at every
 rational number.
 This construction is arrived at through the isomorphism between dyadic
 fractions and Farey Numbers by means of the Minkowski Question Mark function.
 Essentially, we can represent every rational as a continued fraction, and
 define gaps analogously.
 This idea is developed further in another chapter (chapter XXX).

The insight that we wish to provide here is that the two endpoints of Cantor's
 interval construction can also be mapped to the left and right derivatives
 of the Takagi function.
 That is, for any dyadic rational 
\begin_inset Formula $p/2^{n}$
\end_inset 

 for odd integer 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

, we have two inequivalent binary sequences that represent this rational.
 Each sequence can be used to build a distinct polynomial.
 The value of two polynomials at the rational are the two endpoints of an
 interval in the Cantor Set construction.
 But these two endpoints are also the left and right derivatives of the
 Takagi Curve.
 One sequence maps to the derivative of the Takagi function on one side
 of this rational, and the other to the other side of this rational.
