\layout Abstract

This breif note defines the idea of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

very fat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Cantor set, and breifly examines the measure associated with such a very
 fat Cantor set.
\layout Abstract

The canonical Cantor set is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

thin
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in that it has a measure of zero.
 There are a variety of methods by which on can construct 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

fat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Cantor sets (also known as Smith-Volterra-Cantor sets) which have a measure
 greater than zero.
 One of the commonest constructions, based on the dyadic numbers, has a
 continuously-varying parameter that is associated with the measure.
 The Smith-Volterra-Cantor set attains a measure of one for a finite value
 of the parameter; this paper then explores what happens when the parameter
 is pushed beyond this value.
 These are the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

very fat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Cantor sets refered to in the title.
 The results consist almost entirely of a set of graphs showing this behaviour.
\layout Abstract

This paper is part of a set of chapters that explore the relationship between
 the real numbers, the modular group, and fractals.

Intro
\layout Standard

THIS IS A DRAFT.
 The intro hasn't been written yet, but if it was, it would work like this:
 
\layout Standard

The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

very fat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Cantor set and the concept of its measure is defined, and some of these
 are graphed.
 
\layout Standard

Although much could be said about the topology associated with this construction
, nothing is said here.
\layout Standard

Although the symmetry properties of the resulting measures could be analyzed
 in light of the SL(2,Z) period-doubling monoid symmetry, they are not.
 Maybe later.
\layout Section

Dyadic numbers, Cantor Sets and Measures
\layout Standard

The real numbers can be expressed with the binary digit or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

dyadic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 expansion
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{b_{k}}{2^{k}}\label{eq: binary expansion}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This expansion is not unique, because for every dyadic number, there are
 two inequivalent expansions.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2=0.1000..=0.0111...$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

The canonical Cantor function may be cconstructed from this expansion, as
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
c_{z}(x)=(1-z)\,\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}b_{k}z^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Clearly, for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1/2$
\end_inset 

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1/2}(x)=x$
\end_inset 

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1/3$
\end_inset 

, we have essentially the inverse of the classic Cantor function, as show
 in the figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Cantor-Polynomial}

\end_inset 

.

This figure shows a graph of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset 

 for a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1/3$
\end_inset 

.
 This graph provides possibly the easiest visual proof that the cardinality
 of the Cantor Set is equal to the cardinality of the unit interval
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-14}

\end_inset 

, a result which can sometimes be difficult to visualize.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1/3}(x)$
\end_inset 

 maps the unit interval into the unit interval.
 It is strictly monotonically increasing, and if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\neq y$
\end_inset 

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1/3}(x)\neq c_{1/3}(y)$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, this function is one-to-one, and thus the cardinality of the image
 is equal to the cardinality of the unit interval.
 But the image of this function is just the canonical Cantor set, constructed
 by recursively removing the open middle-third interval.
 The largest 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

middle-third
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset 

; the next two largest correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/4$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x=3/4$
\end_inset 

, and so on: each removed interval corresponds to a rational number, expressed
 as its binary expansion.
 It is not hard to see that that the sum of the lengths of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

middle thirds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 adds up to one, and thus, the measure of the image of this function is
 zero.
 Thus, we have quickly sketched that the cardinality of the Cantor set is
 that of the real numbers, but the measure of the Cantor Set is zero.
 It is not hard to see that one gets a similar result using 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset 

 for any value of 
\begin_inset Formula $0<z<1/2$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

There were only two 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

tricky
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 parts to this demonstration.
 One is the assertion that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)\neq c_{z}(y)$
\end_inset 

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $x\neq y$
\end_inset 

, but this can be deduced easily enough by contemplating the definition
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 The other trick we slid by here was that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset 

 is somewhat vaguely defined for the rationals: every dyadic rational number
 
\begin_inset Formula $x=p/2^{n}$
\end_inset 

 has two inequivalent binary expansions.
 For example, x=1/2=0.1000...=0.0111...
 and the first binary expansion yeilds 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(1/2)=1-z$
\end_inset 

 while the second yeilds 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(1/2)=z$
\end_inset 

.
 But this doesn't affect the proof: however we choose to tighten up the
 definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset 

, it is still one-to-one and monotonic, and its image still has the cardinality
 of the unit interval.

We now want to consider how this function maps a measure defined on the
 domain to the range of the function.
\layout Standard

Each of the following figures shows the distribution of the uniform measure
 on the domain as it is mapped to the codomain.
 This is done by box-counting over a finite set of intervals.
 For example, one starts by dividing up the unit interval into 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n}$
\end_inset 

equal-length intervals, whose endpoints lie on integral multiples of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-n}$
\end_inset 

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{z}(x)$
\end_inset 

, for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

, is used to map each of these intervals.
 To avoid the ambiguity of which binary expansion to use, the map that results
 in the shortest possible interval is used.
 Each of these intervals is then histogrammed over a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 boxes, and then normalized, to generate an image.
 The normalization is such that the sum of the histogram (the sum total
 of the boxes) is normalized to one.
 In principle, each such figure generated will depend not only on the number
 of dyadic intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n}$
\end_inset 

 but also on the number of bars 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 in the histogram.
 In paractice, most (but not all) such figures will exhibit a limiting behaviour
 for large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

, and care is taken to try to always present a figure in this limiting regime.
 Exceptions to this are noted.
\layout Standard

The most remarkable aspect of this series of figures is how drastically
 different each of these look, for even small changes in the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

.
 Also remarkable is that as 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 gets larger and larger, the figures become smooth.

 This is essentially a diagram of the classic, canonical Cantor set.
 The height of the bars is a simple function of the number of bars 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

 The un-evenness of the bar heights is a symptom of the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2001$
\end_inset 

 is not divisible by 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset 

, and so one has a jittering effect.

 Although this figure appears to be smooth, it is not: there are still small-sca

 Here, the size of these are small enough to give the appearance of smoothness.
 Note this figure seems sinusouidal; it is not, as the next figure reveals.
 It also at first seems Gaussian in shape: again, it cannot be, as support
 vanishes outside of the interval
