The Simple Harmonic Oscillator

\layout Abstract

An exploration of the non-square-integrable eigenfunctions of the quantum
 simple harmonic oscillator.
 Unlike the square-integrable eigenfunctions, these form a continuous spectrum,
 and in fact a Riemann surface.
 The eigenfunctions themselves are given by the confluent hypergeometric
 series (Kummer's function).

Introduction to basic notation.
 The classical hamiltonian:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{H}=\frac{p^{2}}{2m}+\frac{1}{2}\, m\omega^{2}x^{2}\]

\end_inset 

 Quantized by taking 
\begin_inset Formula \[
p=-i\hbar\frac{d}{dx}\]

\end_inset 

 with classic square-integrable eigenfunctions forming a Hilbert space:
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}n!}}\left(\frac{m\omega}{\pi\hbar}\right)^{1/4}\exp\left(-\frac{m\omega x^{2}}{2\hbar}\right)H_{n}\left(\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}}x\right)\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 is an integer, and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are the Hermite polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula \[
H_{n}(y)=\left(-1\right)^{n}\exp\left(y^{2}\right)\frac{d^{n}}{dy^{n}}\exp\left(-y^{2}\right)\]

\end_inset 

There are eigenfunctions: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{H}\psi_{n}=\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\psi_{n}\]

\end_inset 

 It is convenient to eliminate the extraneous constants.
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula \[
y=\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}}x\]

\end_inset 

 one then has that the Hamiltonian is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
H=\frac{\mathcal{H}}{\hbar\omega}=\frac{1}{2}\left(-\frac{d^{2}}{dy^{2}}+y^{2}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 The remainder of this paper will be devoted to exploring the continuous-spectru
m solutions of this normalized Hamiltonian, that is, discovering and describing
 the solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(y)$
\end_inset 

 of 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H\psi=\lambda\psi\label{eq:general sho hamiltonian}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset 

 the complex plane.

Confluent Hypergeometric Solutions
\layout Standard

This section derives the confluent hypergeometric eigenfunctions.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi(y)=\exp\left(-\frac{y^{2}}{2}\right)\varphi(y)\]

\end_inset 

 Then the differential equation becomes 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\varphi^{\prime\prime}-2y\varphi^{\prime}+\left(2\lambda-1\right)\varphi=0\]

\end_inset 

 Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $z=y^{2}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(z)=\varphi(y)$
\end_inset 

, one obtains the differential equation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
z\eta^{\prime\prime}+\left(\frac{1}{2}-z\right)\eta^{\prime}-\left(\frac{1-2\lambda}{4}\right)\eta=0\]

\end_inset 

which may be immediately recognized as Kummer's differential equation for
 the confluent hypergeometric functions: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
z\eta^{\prime\prime}+\left(b-z\right)\eta^{\prime}-a\eta=0\]

\end_inset 

 which has solutions 
\begin_inset Formula \[
M(a,b;z)=_{1}F_{1}(a,b;z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(a)_{n}}{(b)_{n}}\,\frac{z^{n}}{n!}\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
U(a,b;z)=\frac{\pi}{\sin\pi b}\left[\frac{M(a,b;z)}{\Gamma(1+a-b)\Gamma(b)}+z^{1-b}\,\frac{M(1+a-b,2-b;z)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(2-b)}\right]\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $(a)_{n}=a(a+1)\cdots(a+n-1)$
\end_inset 

 is the rising factorial.
 From the point of view of presenting solutions to equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:general sho hamiltonian}

\end_inset 

, there are only two linearly independent solutions.
 These are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi_{1}(y)=e^{-y^{2}/2}M\left(\frac{1-2\lambda}{4},\frac{1}{2};\, y^{2}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi_{2}(y)=y\, e^{-y^{2}/2}M\left(\frac{3-2\lambda}{4},\frac{3}{2};\, y^{2}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 The appropriate normalization for these two solutions is not yet clear,
 since neither is square-integral along the real 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

-line, except when 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=n+1/2$
\end_inset 

, of course.

This figure shows a phase plot of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}(y)$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=4.5$
\end_inset 

, which corresponds to the integer eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4$
\end_inset 

 for the standard quantum harmonic oscillator.
 The square represents values of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

 on the complex plane, bounded by the square 
\begin_inset Formula $-6\le\Re y\le6$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-6\le\Im y\le6$
\end_inset 

.
 The colors denote values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\arg\psi_{1}$
\end_inset 

, with black representing 
\begin_inset Formula $\arg\psi_{1}=-\pi$
\end_inset 

, green 
\begin_inset Formula $\arg\psi_{1}=0$
\end_inset 

 and red a phase of 
\begin_inset Formula $+\pi$
\end_inset 

.
 Zeros are clearly visible as points around which the full spectrum of colors
 wrap around.
 This images shows four zeros, arranged in the real axis, which are located
 exactly at the zeros of the Hermite polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{4}(y)$
\end_inset 

.
 As the image suggests, there are no other zeros on the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

 plane.
 The images for other values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=n+1/2$
\end_inset 

 for positive integer values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 are qualitatively similar, with the exception that addtional zeros appear
 on the real axis, along with similarly appropriate asymptotic behaviour
 along the imaginary axis,

This figure shows a phase plot of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}(y)$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=4.505$
\end_inset 

.
 The domain and color scheme are exactly as those for the image 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Phase-plot-of-psi}

\end_inset 

.
 Unlike image for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=4.5$
\end_inset 

, there are additional zeros.
 Two appear on the real axis, and, more notably, a hyperbola-like arrangement
 of zeros asymptotically approaching the 45-degree diagonals.
 As the graphic suggests, there are an infinite number of these.
 The asymptotes can be explained by noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(y^{2}/2)$
\end_inset 

 behaves like the sine function along the 
\begin_inset Formula $y=r\,\exp\pm i\pi/4$
\end_inset 

 diagonals.
 The images for other real values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

 are qualitatively similar, provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

 is not a half-integer.
 It should be noted that the appearance of the zeros at the diagonals is
 completely discontinuous as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

, in that the figure for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=4.5+\epsilon$
\end_inset 

 for arbitrarily small 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\ne0$
\end_inset 

 will look essentially like this figure, while that for 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0$
\end_inset 

 will be that of figure

\end_inset 

, there are no longer any zeros on the real axis.
 In a qualtitative sense, the number of zeros have remained the same; the
 location have changed.
 The 45-degree diagonal asymptotes appear to be unaltered.
 Figures for similar nearby values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

 are qualitatively similar.

 The square-root was choosen out of recognition that the dominant hyperbola-like
 features of the previous graphs are nothing other than the typical feature
 of a phase plot of the square of domain.
 Removing this distraction more clearly shows the primary qualities of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}$
\end_inset 

.
 As in the figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Phase-plot-of-psi}

\end_inset 

, the only zeros are on the real axis.
 This is in sharp contrast to any value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

 which is not exactly a half-integer.
