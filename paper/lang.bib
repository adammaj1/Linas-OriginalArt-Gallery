A sequence of words is in the language of a link grammar if there is a way to draw links between words in such a way that (1) the local requirements of each word are satisfied, (2) the links do not cross, and (3) the words form a connected graph. We have encoded English grammar into such a system, and written a program (based on new algorithms) for efficiently parsing with a link grammar. The formalism is lexical and makes no...},
