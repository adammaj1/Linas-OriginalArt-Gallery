A sequence of words is in the language of a link grammar if there is a way to draw links between words in such a way that (1) the local requirements of each word are satisfied, (2) the links do not cross, and (3) the words form a connected graph. We have encoded English grammar into such a system, and written a program (based on new algorithms) for efficiently parsing with a link grammar. The formalism is lexical and makes no...},

tree structures in which semantic (lexical dependency) and syntactic
(PCFG) structures are scored with separate models. This factorization
provides conceptual simplicity, straightforward opportunities for
separately improving the component models, and a level of performance
comparable to similar, non-factored models. Most importantly, unlike
other modern parsing models, the factored model admits an extremely
effective A* parsing algorithm, which enables efficient, exact
inference.},

Markov logic combines the two by attaching weights to first-order formulas and viewing them as templates for features of Markov networks. Inference algorithms for Markov logic draw on ideas from satisfiability, Markov chain Monte Carlo and knowledge-based model construction. Learning algorithms are based on the voted perceptron, pseudo-likelihood and inductive logic programming. Markov logic has been successfully applied to problems in entity resolution, link prediction, information extraction and others, and is the basis of the open-source Alchemy system.},
