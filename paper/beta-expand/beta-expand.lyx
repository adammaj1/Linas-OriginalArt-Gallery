\begin_layout Title
The Beta Expansion as a Dynamical System

\begin_layout Abstract
A beta-expansion is a representation of a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 written in the form 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum_{n}k_{n}\beta^{-n}$
\end_inset

 for a fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta\le2$
\end_inset

 and a string of binary digits 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Such expansions are not unique, in general, and, for almost all 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and almost all 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 there are an uncountable number of equivalent expansions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This text explores these classes of equivalent expansions.
 They can be organized into an infinite binary tree (whence uncountability).
 This tree induces a measure-preserving dynamical system, a subshift on
 the Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is closely related to the subshift arising from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation is the iterated map 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta x\,\mod1$
\end_inset

.
 The resulting invariant measure (the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron measure) is
 explored numerically and compared to the Renyi-Gelfond-Parry measure for
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation.
 The distance between branch-points in the infinite binary tree can be obtained
 from this measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform is the iterated map 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

 applied to the unit interval on the real number line.
 A very special case of this map is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

, which is named the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dyadic transform
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The dyadic transform is, in a certain sense, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

completely solvable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that it has been heavily studied and is well-understood.
 It's dynamics is described by the Bernoulli process.
 It is ergodic, and corresponds to a shift operator acting on the Cantor
 space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

: this is the shift that lops off one bit from an infinite bit-string.
 The shift can be expressed as a dynamical system; the dissipative part
 of the dynamical system is described by a transfer operator (the Ruelle-Frobeni
us-Perron operator) acting on the Borel algebra (sigma algebra) associated
 to the Cantor space.
 The spectrum of the transfer operator is discrete, when limited to the
 real-analytic functions; the spectrum is continuous when acting on square-integ
rable functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not as much is known for the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\ne2$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform is still a shift, in that it can still be understood as a way
 of lopping off one bit from an infinite bit-string in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 However, not all possible bit-strings can occur; it is a subshift, in that
 there is a subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $B\subset\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform.
 Corresponding to this invariance is an invariant measure, first demonstrated
 by Renyi, and given explicit form by Gelfond and Parry.
 As an invariant measure, it is the eigenvalue-one (the Frobenius-Perron
 eigenvalue) eigenfunction of the transfer operator.
 The remaining spectrum of the transfer operator is poorly understood, but
 is explored by this author in a different text.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 Understanding the dissipative spectrum is important, as it explicitly describes
 the rate of convergence of numerical explorations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Cantor space can be mapped to the reals in the unit interval, by interpretin
g a bit-string in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 as a binary expansion of a real number.
 Famously, the mapping is surjective, in that the dyadic rationals have
 two inequivalent binary expansions: a dyadic rational can be written either
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k}1000\cdots$
\end_inset

 ending in an infinite string of zeros, or as 
\begin_inset Formula $0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k}0111\cdots$
\end_inset

 ending in an infinite string of one's.
 The dyadic rationals are in one-to-one correspondence with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gaps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the (conventional) Cantor set (the one with middle-thirds removed.) These
 gaps are also in one-to-one correspondence with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gaps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between the left-right subtrees in an infinite tree; they are also in one-to-on
e correspondence with the cusps of modular forms (as the infinite binary
 tree can be mapped into the modular group).
 For the general 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\ne2,$
\end_inset

the situation changes: rather than there being only two (in-)equivalent
 binary expansions, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 (that is, uncountably many) of them! This text is an exploration of these
 expansions for the general case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the introduction introduces all of the various basic ideas
 and notations pertinent to this system, followed by a short literature
 review.
 The introduction is written at a very low level of mathematical sophistication,
 and presumes almost no prior acquaintance with dynamical systems; this
 text is meant to be approachable by casual mathematical enthusiasts.
 After the introduction, the main results of this paper are presented; they
 are almost entirely grounded in a numerical exploration, as obtaining formal
 results is quite daunting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main results follow in order: the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gaps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be organized into an infinite binary tree; the locations of the branch
 points in the tree can be explicitly specified; the distance between branch-poi
nts can be explicitly stated.
 The specification of the branch-points induces a dynamical system; it has
 an invariant measure (which is not the Gelfond-Parry measure).
 The distances between branch-points can be directly related to this measure.
 The text terminates with a short conclusion and some speculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bernoulli shift
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bernoulli shift (
\emph on
aka
\emph default
 the bit-shift map, the dyadic transform or the full shift) is an iterated
 map on the unit interval, given by iteration of the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b(x)=\begin{cases}
2x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
2x-1 & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:Bernoulli shift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The symbolic dynamics of this map gives the binary digit expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 That is, write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b^{n}(x)=(b\circ b\circ\cdots\circ b)(x)=b(b(\cdots b(x)\cdots))
\]

\end_inset

to denote the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-fold iteration of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{0}(x)=x$
\end_inset

.
 The symbolic dynamics is given by the bit-sequence
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b_{n}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{ if }0\le b^{n}(x)<\frac{1}{2}\\
1 & \mbox{ if }\frac{1}{2}\le b^{n}(x)\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:bernoulli-bits}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

(Attention: 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is a subscript on the left, and a superscript on the right! The left is
 a sequence, the right is an iteration.
 Using the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 one both sides is a convenient abuse of notation.) Of course, the symbolic
 dynamics recreates the initial real number:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_{n}\left(x\right)2^{-n-1}\label{eq:homomorphism}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

All of this is just a fancy way of saying that a real number can be written
 in terms of it's base-2 binary expansion.
 That is, the binary digits for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 are the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}=b_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bernoulli shift has many interesting properties, connecting it to the
 Cantor set and a large class of self-similar fractals.
 It is also connected to the modular group and elliptic functions (thence
 to number theory and Riemann surfaces).
 It is also the primary example of an ergodic system, and, in a sense, has
 far-reaching implications for ergodic systems via Ornstein theory.
 These various connections are far too numerous to review here, beyond these
 brief mentions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current task is to attempt to see how many of these properties still
 hold in the more general case of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shift space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shift space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is formally defined to be a set of infinite sequences of a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 letters (or symbols), together with a shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 that takes each sequence, and lops off the left-most symbol.
 For the Bernoulli shift, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

 letters, taken from the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 For the Bernoulli shift, one is typically interested in the set of 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 possible infinite sequences: this is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

full shift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 One writes 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 for this shift space, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 denoting countable infinity.
 For the Bernoulli shift, the map 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is the shift operator: it just lops of the left-most symbol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, a shift space does not have to include every possible sequence
 of symbols; it does, however, by definition, have to be shift-invariant.
 That is, given some set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of infinite sequences of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 symbols, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a shift space if and only if, by loping off the leading symbol of each
 string, one regains 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 again.
 That is, a shift space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 must obey 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
TS=S
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\left\{ 000\cdots,111\cdots\right\} $
\end_inset

 contains only two elements: the string of all zeros, and the string of
 all ones; loping off the leading digit just returns 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 again.
 In general, shift spaces may contain a finite, or a countable, or an uncountabl
e number of elements.
 In general, one defines the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

full shift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the space 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 of all possible strings of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 symbols.
 Subsets that are shift spaces are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subshifts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

symbolic dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 also deserve some mention: given one specific sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in S$
\end_inset

 out of the shift space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, one can ponder 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where it goes to
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as one lops off a symbol at a time.
 This gives the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

symbolic dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the sequence.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

orbit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is defined as the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ T^{m}x\,|\,\mbox{integer }m\ge0\right\} $
\end_inset

 ‚Äì that is, the set of all places that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 goes to.
 There are several possibilities: one is that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a fixed point, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $Tx=x$
\end_inset

.
 Another is that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a repeating sequence of symbols, in which case iteration repeats as
 well: 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{m}x=x$
\end_inset

 holds whenever the repeat length is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

; this is a periodic orbit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most importantly, when there are non-periodic orbits, then there are uncountably
 many of them.
 That is, the number of periodic orbits is always countable: there are at
 most 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 starting points for an orbit, and they are of at most length 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 This includes the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eventually periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 orbits: those that begin with some finite initial sequence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 moves, eventually settling into a periodic recurrence.
 This cannot be done for the non-periodic orbits: they cannot be placed
 in lexicographic order; as the Cantor slash argument applies.
 The non-periodic orbits are always uncountable.
 In this sense, the non-periodic orbits are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more important
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that the make up the bulk of all orbits.
 There are situations in which the periodic orbits can be said to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

govern
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the dynamics of the aperiodic ones; this is termed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coherent structure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However such concepts are advanced, and are not obviously applicable to
 the current situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Beta shift
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta shift is similar to the Bernoulli shift, replacing the number 2
 by a constant real-number value 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta\le2$
\end_inset

.
 It can be defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\beta}(x)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:downshift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Just as the Bernoulli shift generates a sequence of digits, so does the
 beta shift: write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
k_{n}=\begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{ if }0\le T_{\beta}^{n}(x)<\frac{1}{2}\\
1 & \mbox{ if }\frac{1}{2}\le T_{\beta}^{n}(x)\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:down-bits}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Given the symbolic dynamics, one can reconstruct the original value whenever
 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\frac{k_{0}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{1}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{2}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{3}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\cdots\right)\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

Written this way, the 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}(x)$
\end_inset

 clearly acts as a shift on this sequence:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}(x)=\frac{k_{1}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{2}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{3}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{4}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\cdots\right)\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

In this sense, this shift is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exactly solvable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the above provides a closed-form solution for iterating and un-iterating
 the sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiplying out the above sequence, one obtains the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, namely the series
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{1}{2}\,\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{k_{n}}{\beta^{n}}\label{eq:shift series}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, the bit-sequence that was extracted by iteration can be used to
 reconstruct the original real number.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

 in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bernoulli-bits"

\end_inset

 gives the Bernoulli shift: 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}\left(x\right)=b\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the Bernoulli shift, not every possible bit-sequence occurs in this
 system.
 It is a subshift of the full shift: it is a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 This is explored in greater detail in a later section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Density Visualizations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

long-term dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift can be visualized by means of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bifurcation diagram
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Scare quotes are used, as these are imprecise terms; greater precision
 will be provided shortly.
 The idea of a bifurcation diagram was made famous by the Feigenbaum map,
 and so the same idea is applied here: track orbits over long periods of
 time, and see where they go.
 This forms a density, which can be numerically explored by histogramming.
 This is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Undershift-Bifurcation-Diagram"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this is done for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift, one thing becomes immediately apparent: there are no actual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bifurcations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, no period-doubling regions, none of the stuff normally associated with
 the Feigenbaum map.
 Although there are periodic orbits, these form a set of measure zero: the
 iteration produces purely chaotic motion for almost all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>1$
\end_inset

.
 In this sense, the beta transform provides a clean form of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pure chaos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Formal mathematics distinguishes between many different kinds of chaotic
 number sequences: those that are ergodic, those that are weakly or strongly
 Bernoulli, weakly or strongly mixing.
 The beta transform is known to be ergodic,

\end_layout

\end_inset

 without the pesky 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 popping up intermittently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The visualization of the long-term dynamics is done by generating a histogram,
 and then taking the limit, as follows.
 One divides the unit interval into a fixed sequence of equal-sized bins;
 say a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 bins, so that each is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N$
\end_inset

 in width.
 Pick a starting 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and then iterate: if, at the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th iteration, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $j/N\le b_{\beta}^{n}(x)<(j+1)/N$
\end_inset

, then increment the count for the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

'th bin.
 After a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 iterations, let 
\begin_inset Formula $c(j;M)$
\end_inset

 be the count in the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

'th bin.
 This count is the histogram.
 In the limit of a large number of iterations, as well as small bin sizes,
 one obtains a distribution: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho(y;x)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\lim_{M\to\infty}\frac{c(j;M)}{M}\mbox{ for }\frac{j}{N}\le y<\frac{j+1}{N}
\]

\end_inset

This distribution depends on the initial value 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 chosen for the point to be iterated; a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nice
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 distribution results when one averages over all starting points:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho(y)=\int_{0}^{1}\rho(y;x)\,dx
\]

\end_inset

Numerically, this integration can be achieved by randomly sampling a large
 number of starting points.
 Observe that, by definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(y)$
\end_inset

 is a probability distribution:
\begin_inset Formula

Probability distributions are the same thing as measures; they assign a
 density to each point on the unit interval.
 It can be shown that this particular distribution is invariant under iteration,
 and thus is often called the invariant measure, or sometimes the Haar measure.

Beta Transformation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After exactly one iteration of the beta shift, all initial points 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 are swept up into the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

, and never leave.
 Likewise, the range of the iterated beta-shift is 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, an alternative representation of the beta shift, filling the entire
 unit square, can be obtained by dividing both the domain and range by 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2$
\end_inset

 to obtain the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t_{\beta}(u)=\begin{cases}
\beta u & \mbox{ for }0\le u<\frac{1}{\beta}\\
\beta u-1 & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{\beta}\le u\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:beta transform}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This can be written more compactly as 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

.
 In this form, the function is named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the beta-transform
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, written as the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation, presenting a typesetting challenge to search engines when
 used in titles of papers.
 The orbit of a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in the beta-shift is identical to the orbit of a point 
\begin_inset Formula $u=2x/\beta$
\end_inset

 in the beta-transformation.
 Explicitly comparing to the beta-shift of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{n}\left(x\right)=\frac{\beta}{2}t_{\beta}^{n}\left(\frac{2x}{\beta}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The beta-shift and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation are essentially 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the same function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; this text works almost exclusively with the beta-shift, and is thus idiosyncra
tic, as it flouts the more common convention of working with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation.
 The primary reason for doing this is to retain contact with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift being a subshift of the full shift.

Dynamical Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A brief review of dynamical systems is in order, as it provides a coherent
 language with which to talk about and think about the beta-shift.
 Understanding this avoids the need for weasel-words and imprecise hand-waving
 when making claims and statements; common phrases can be given a precise
 meaning.
 This section reviews textbook-standard material; it is included here only
 to allow this text to be self-contained.
 Later parts of this text will appeal to ideas presented here.

\begin_layout Standard
The Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 can be given a topology, the product topology.
 The open sets of this topology are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cylinder sets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These are strings in three symbols: a finite number of 0 and 1 symbols,
 and an infinite number of * symbols, the latter meaning 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

don't care
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Set union is defined location-by-location, with 
\begin_inset Formula $0\cup*=1\cup*=*$
\end_inset

 and set intersection as 
\begin_inset Formula $0\cap*=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\cap*=1$
\end_inset

.
 Set complement exchanges 0 and 1 and leaves * alone: 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{0}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{*}=*$
\end_inset

.
 The topology is then the collection of all cylinder sets.
 Note that the intersection of any finite number of cylinder sets is still
 a cylinder set, as is the union of an infinite number of them.
 The product topology does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 contain any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: strings consisting solely of just 0 and 1 are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 allowed in the topology.
 By definition, topologies only allow finite intersections, and thus don't
 provide any way of constructing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Of course, points can always be added 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

by hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but doing so tends to generate a topology (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

box topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too fine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; in particular, the common-sense notions of a continuous function are ruined
 by fine topologies.
 The product topology is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coarse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Borel algebra, or sigma-algebra, takes the topology and also allows
 set complement.
 This effectively changes nothing, as the open sets are still the cylinder
 sets, although now they are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clopen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as they are both closed and open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denote the Borel algebra by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 A shift is now a map 
\begin_inset Formula $T:\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 that lops off the leading symbol of a given cylinder set.
 This is provides the strong theoretical advantages over working with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: confusions about counting points and orbits and defining densities go
 away.
 This is done by recasting discussion in terms of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 from Borel sets to the reals (or the complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 or other fields, when this is interesting).
 An important class of such functions are the measures.
 These are functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 that are positive, and are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compatible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the sigma algebra, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(A\cup B\right)=\mu\left(A\right)+\mu\left(B\right)$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cap B=\varnothing$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(A\cap B\right)=\mu\left(A\right)\mu\left(B\right)$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 For the total space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 (here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is the Cantor space), one case 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\Omega\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prototypical example of a measure is the Bernoulli measure, which assigns
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to any string containing a single 0 and the rest all *'s.
 By complement, a string containing a single 1 and the rest all *'s has
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-p$
\end_inset

.
 The rest follows from the sigma algebra: a cylinder set consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 zeros and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 ones has measure 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{m}\left(1-p\right)^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 It is usually convenient to take 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1/2$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
The map given in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is a homomorphism from the Cantor space to the unit interval.
 It extends naturally to a map from the Borel algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 to the algebra of intervals on the unit interval.
 It is not an isomorphism: cylinder sets are both open and closed, whereas
 intervals on the real number line are either open, or closed (or half-open).
 It is convenient to take the map as a map to closed intervals, so that
 it's a surjection onto the reals, although usually, this detail does not
 matter.
 What does matter is of one takes 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1/2$
\end_inset

, then the Bernoulli measure is preserved: it is mapped onto the conventional
 measure on the real-number line.
 Thus, the cylinder set 
\begin_inset Formula $0***\cdots$
\end_inset

 is mapped to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1/2\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1***\cdots$
\end_inset

 is mapped to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1/2,1\right]$
\end_inset

 and both have a measure of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 and this extends likewise to all intersections and unions.
 Points have a measure of zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the map of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is not an isomorphism, it is more-or-less safe form most practical purposes
 to treat it as such.
 For any closed interval, there is a unique corresponding cylinder set.
 The only trouble arises at a countable number of points: all dyadic rationals
 have two expansions not one, and so there, the map is not invertable.
 However, the points all have a measure of zero in both cases, and there
 are only a countable number of such points, and the mapping always takes
 points to points.
 Thus, the inverse exists for almost all members of the algebra and is unique
 whenever an interval has positive measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much of what is said above still holds for subshifts.
 Recall, a subshift 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $S\subset\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the shift 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $TS=S$
\end_inset

.
 The space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 inherits a topology from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

, this is the subspace topology.
 The Borel algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 is similarly defined, as are measures.
 One can now (finally!) give a precise definition for an invariant measure:
 it is a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\circ T^{-1}=\mu$
\end_inset

, or more precisely, for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(T^{-1}\left(\sigma\right)\right)=\mu\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 for almost all cylinder sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\in S$
\end_inset

.
 This is what shift invariance looks like.
 Note carefully that 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and not 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is used in the definition.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is a surjection while 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is not: every cylinder set 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 in the subshift 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

came from somewhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; we want to define invariance for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and not just for some of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is technically called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pushforward
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and it defines a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 on the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 of all functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 It is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:\mathcal{F\to\mathcal{F}}$
\end_inset

 by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:f\mapsto f\circ T^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 It is obviously linear, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(af+bg\right)=a\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(f\right)+b\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(g\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This pushforward is canonically called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfer operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Like any linear operator, it has a spectrum.
 The precise spectrum depends on the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The canonical example is again the Bernoulli shift.
 For this, we invoke the inverse of the mapping of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is a function defined on the unit interval, instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is the space of real-analytic functions on the unit interval, that is,
 the space all power series in 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

, then the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 is discrete.
 It consists of the Bernoulli polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 corresponding to an eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-n}$
\end_inset

.
 That is,
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}B_{n}=2^{-n}B_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{0}\left(x\right)=1$
\end_inset

 is the invariant measure on the full shift.
 For the space of square-integrable functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

, the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 is continuous, and consists of the unit disk in the complex plane; the
 corresponding eigenfunctions are fractal.
 Even more interesting constructions are possible; the Minkowski question
 mark function provides an example of a measure on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the shift defined by the Gauss map 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(x\right)\mapsto\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

.
 That is, as a measure, it solves 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}?^{\prime}=?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset

 the Minkowski question mark function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 it's derivative; note that the derivative is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continuous nowhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This rather confusing idea (of something being continuous nowhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) can be completely dispelled by observing that it is well-defined on all
 cylinder sets in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 and is finite on all of them ‚Äì not only finite, but less than one, as any
 good measure must obey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These last examples are mentioned so as to reinforce the idea that working
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 instead of the unit interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 really does offer some strong conceptual advantages.
 They also reinforce the idea that the Bernoulli shift is not the only 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

full shift

When the beta expansion is expanded to the entire real-number line, one
 effectively has a representation of reals in a non-integer base.
 One may ask about arithmetic properties, such as the behavior of addition

The Bernoulli process and it's relationship to the Cantor set provides the
 baseline to which the beta-shift can be compared.
 The beta-shift has a number of very striking differences, however, which
 manifest themselves in the structure of the beta-transformations.

More precisely, again consider the binary expansion of a real number
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots
\]

\end_inset

The dyadic rationals, rationals in the form 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\left(2k+1\right)/2^{n}$
\end_inset

 have two equivalent representations:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r=0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{n-2}1000\cdots
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r=0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{n-2}0111\cdots

\end_inset

These are equivalent as real numbers; they are inequivalent as elements

 The term

\begin_inset Formula 
\[

 being the conventional Cantor set as it appears in the reals.
 It obviously has 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

gaps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These are the objects of study here.
 They have a natural interpretation in terms ot the infinite binary tree:
 a gap occurs whenever one makes a left-right decision in travelling down
 the tree.
 The left sub-tree is distinct from the right, and the gap is what lies
 in between.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gap
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is also interesting, as it suggests that the real numbers can be constructed
 from the Cantor set by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

gluing together the gaps
\begin_inset Quotes erd

: a nicely intuitive idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This idea fits nicely with that of Lebesgue dimension.
 The Cantor space is zero-dimensional, in that every point in the Cantor
 space is covered by a single open set (a cylinder set), and every refinement
 of cylinder set is such that the point is contained in one set.
 This is because, in the product topology, all open sets are either disjoint,
 or are subsets of one-another.
 The real number line has Lebesgue covering dimension of one in the natural
 topology: refinements of open covers chain together.
 The double-membership, the double-expansion of the dyadic rationals can
 be understood as the

 The question arises: is this expansion unique, or are there other sequences

 number of equivalent expansions! This is in stark contrast to the binary
 case, where almost all 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 had a unique expansion, and a countable number of them (the dyadic rationals)
 had two expansions (but no more).
 As before, we will call a set of equivalent expansions a

gap
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first important result is that the gap is an infinite binary tree.
 Starting with the sequence

\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}$
\end_inset

, there is a countable sequence of locations 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1},n_{2},\cdots$
\end_inset

 at which an alternate expansion can be made.
 Precisely, define
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m=\left\lfloor \log_{\beta}\frac{\beta-1}{2-\beta}\right\rfloor +1
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lfloor \cdot\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 denotes the floor (the integer part of a number).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{m}$
\end_inset

 be the bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{m}=100\cdots0$
\end_inset

 starting with 1, followed by at least 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 zeros.
 Sidorov shows, by appeal to the PoincareÃÅ recurrence theorem, that this
 bit-sequence occurs in an infinite number of locations in 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1},n_{2},\cdots$
\end_inset

 be the locations of the bits leading up to 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{m}$
\end_inset

.
 Picking one of these locations, say 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{j}$
\end_inset

, write a new sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 by setting 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
k_{n}^{\prime}=\begin{cases}
k_{n} & \mbox{ for }n\le n_{j}\\
0 & \mbox{ for }n=n_{j}+1\\
\kappa_{n} & \mbox{ for }n_{j}+1<n
\end{cases}\label{eq:expanded bits}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the bit-sequence obtained by resuming the expansion 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:down-bits"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 where it has left off.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\kappa_{n_{j}+p}=k_{p}\left(\beta T_{\beta}^{n_{j}}(x)\right)
\]

\end_inset

for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $1<p$
\end_inset

.
 This new sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 does not evade the theorem; it too has an infinite sequence of the cylinders
 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{m}$
\end_inset

 embedded in it.
 Thus one obtains an infinite binary tree: at location 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

, one gets to make a decision: should the expansion proceed with 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n_{1}+1}$
\end_inset

 being a zero, or a one? Should one go low, or go high? Go left, or go right?
 This is the binary decision tree; the gap is an infinite binary tree.

 The color coding is such that pixels with an average density of 1.0 are

 to blue.
 Black areas have no hits.
 Thus, the top row is green, as for the top row, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\beta$

 and so all expansions give the same value 
\begin_inset Formula $x=w$

 The answer becomes apparent after some thought: they are the result of
 failing to take a 'mod 1' at certain times during the iteration.
 That is, the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}^{n}(x)$
\end_inset

 obeys 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le T_{\beta}^{n}(x)<\beta/2$

 can generate the desired gaps only if the input sequence breaks out of
 this bound at the cylinder locations 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 As there are an uncountable number of such locations for (almost) every
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, then perhaps these accumulate to form a non-zero measure, extending beyond
 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This argument can be made more plausible if it can be shown that the spacing
 between the alternative expansion points tends to a constant.
 So, for example, if every fifth bit is a location where an alternative
 expansion can be made, then one might expect that one-fifth of the extended
 measure to fall outside the bound 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 This intuitive idea needs to be firmed up, as the expansion points are
 not merely points in a linear sequence, but are points in a binary tree.
 That is, the length of the branches in the tree must be measured, and averaged.

Towards this end, let 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 denote the infinite binary tree, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 denote a specific location on the tree.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is an index into the tree.
 The natural representation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is as a finite sequence of left-right moves.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 can be represented as a finite string of binary digits.
 Alternately, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 can be represented as a sequence of left-moves, followed by a mirror, and
 again some left moves, 
\emph on
etc.

\emph default
 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}r\cdots rg^{a_{m}}$

 or, more compactly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=(a_{1},a_{2},\cdots,a_{m})$
\end_inset

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 These are obviously the binary and the continued-fraction representations
 for a location on the tree.
 It is convenient to define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{len}:D\to\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

 by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{len}\gamma$
\end_inset

 to the number of left-right moves in 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{len}$
\end_inset

 just counts the depth into the tree; equivalently, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{len }\gamma$
\end_inset

 is the length of the string 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 (in the binary representation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p:D\to\mathbb{N}$

 whenever

 For the present situation, we wish to take

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 to be the length of the bitstring

 The average distance between branch points is then

 Regrouping terms, let 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{n}\left(\beta\right)=\frac{1}{2^{n}}\sum_{\gamma:\mbox{len}\gamma=n}p\left(\gamma\right)

be the average distance (pathlength) down to the

 The numbering here is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the first branch point, which is, in general, a few bits
 into the string.
 This implies that the average distance between branch-points can then be
 taken to be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest route to obtaining some insight into 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 is by numerical exploration; for the measure, numerical histogramming is
 a straight-forward way of getting a glimpse.
 Towards that end, the first 22 values of

\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 were computed for several hundred distinct values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.5$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.7$
\end_inset

.
 In both cases, it seems that the value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 does have an 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 dependence, but it appears to be small and bounded, so that it's more or
 less flat.
 The numerical data hint at some fractal behavior, but it is small and hard
 to discern.
 A sample distribution at 
\begin_inset Formula $n=12$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.66$
\end_inset

 is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The numerics hint that 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 converges uniformly to a relatively flat distribution (as a function of
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

).
 Thus, for the remainder, define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\ell}_{n}\left(\beta\right)=\int_{0}^{1}\ell_{n}\left(\beta\right)dx
\]

\end_inset

This appears to be well-defined, as the results from Sidorov state that
 there are distinct 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansions for almost every 
\begin_inset Formula $0<x<1$
\end_inset

, and certainly the numerics show nothing amiss.
 This definition will soon be replaced by a more appropriate one, in the
 next section, which integrates over an appropriate invariant measure.
 However, as that measure has not yet been specified, the above will serve
 as a suitable interim definition.
 It's a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reasonable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 definition of the average distance between branch points.

 A total of three samples were taken for each of 403 locations on the interval

 Due to the rapid convergence, this figure can be taken as the numeric estimate
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\ell}\left(\beta\right)$

 The rapid convergence can be intuitively explained by the spectrum of transfer
 operator of the beta shift.
 The decaying eigenvalues

The distribution of the distances seems to be well-behaved.
 Define the variation as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{var}s_{n}\left(\beta\right)=\frac{1}{2^{n}}\sum_{\gamma:\mbox{len}\gamma=n}p^{2}\left(\gamma\right)
\]

\end_inset

so that the root-mean-square varation becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{rms}\hat{\ell}\left(\beta\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt{\frac{\int_{0}^{1}\mbox{var}s_{n}\left(\beta\right)dx-\hat{\ell}_{n}^{2}\left(\beta\right)}{n}}
\]

\end_inset

The numeric evidence suggests that the limit exists, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\ell}\left(\beta\right)=\mbox{rms}\hat{\ell}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 holds exactly.
 Likewise, define the longest distance btween two branch-points at a given
 level as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\max s_{n}\left(\beta\right)=\max_{\gamma:\mbox{len}\gamma=n}p\left(\gamma\right)
\]

\end_inset

and similarly, the same quantity averaged over all starting points 
\begin_inset Formula $0<x<1$
\end_inset

 in the unit interval:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\max\hat{\ell}\left(\beta\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\int_{0}^{1}\max s_{n}dx}{n}
\]

\end_inset

The numeric evidence suggests that this limit exists and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\max\hat{\ell}\left(\beta\right)=\left(\left(2-\beta\right)/\left(1+\beta\right)\right)\hat{\ell}\left(\beta\right)$

 Intuitively, having dense branch-points suggests that the corresponding

 In this case, one then expects the out-of-bounds measure to be roughly

 This can be made precise.

Each alternative expansion arises from an alternative orbit.
 Let

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 It is a sequence of left-right moves down the tree.
 Denote these moves as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\left(\gamma_{0},\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2},\cdots\right)$

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{k}=0$

 By construction, one has that each of these bit-strings provide an inequivalent

 For any fixed path

 However, there are an uncountable number of paths

 on the real number line with a non-zero measure.
\end_layout

 Let

the subshift 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 likewise.
 That is a subshift follows in a relatively straight-forward fashion.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 be the shift operator that simply lops one bit of of a bit-string.
 One then has that 
\begin_inset Formula $TS^{\prime}\subseteq S^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 because each such string is still a 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion, via eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:beta expansion"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 That 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is surjective should be fairly obvious: if there was some bit-string 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 that could not be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $T\kappa^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 for some other 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa^{\prime}\in S^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, then the corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion would be neither 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta x$
\end_inset

 nor 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

, a contradiction.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $TS^{\prime}=S^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 extends to an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

 acting on cylinder sets.
 By the same argument, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{TS}^{\prime}=\mathcal{S}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 That 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

 is an injection follows essentially from the properties of a sigma-algebra:
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

 preserves unions and intersections, so that if there were two different
 cylinder sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma,\sigma^{\prime}\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}\sigma=\mathcal{T}\sigma^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\backslash\sigma^{\prime}=\varnothing$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}^{-1}:\mathcal{S^{\prime}\to\mathcal{S}^{\prime}}$
\end_inset

 is well-defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may now consider some space of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 with elements 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 are maps 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{S^{\prime}}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 acts as a pushforward, defining a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:\mathcal{F}\to\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 by composition 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}f=f\circ\mathcal{T}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 As a linear operator, this has a spectrum.
 As it corresponds to a shift, the Frobenius-Perron theorem applies.
 The largest eigenvalue is some invariant measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\beta}:\mathcal{S^{\prime}}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}\mu_{\beta}=\mu_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 This measure can be taken to be the restriction of the Bernoulli measure
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 to the subalgebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 does not actually depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, only the subalgebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}^{\prime}=\mathcal{S}_{\beta}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 This holds likewise for the Renyi‚ÄìGelfond‚ÄìParry measure: it is just the
 usual Bernoulli measure restricted to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

.
 It looks unusual when mapped to the unit interval, but that is entirely
 because the mapping of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 to the unit interval is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unusual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I beleive that this is effectively an application of Ornstein theory to
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform.
 Ornstein theory basically just says that there is a large range of disparate
 phenomena, but that the underlying dynamics is that of the Bernoulli process;
 the phenomena look different only because they are obscured by different
 mappings from the Bernoulli process to the system in question.

All this is a round-about way of saying that we really want to do is to
 visualize the orbits of eqn

 The observation that the underlying measure

 is just the Bernoulli measure implies that each and every point can be
 given an equal weighting.
 For numerical purposes, this states that the histogramming of the orbits
 of

\end_inset

, giving each one equal weight as it is assigned to a bin, is an accurate
 technique to approximate to the true measure

With that out of the way, visualizations of the measure can now be given.
 It's notationally convenient to re-insert the subscript

 The jitteriness in the graphs is purely numerical sampling noise; the actual

\begin_layout Subsection
Average distance from the invariant measure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 between branching points is directly related to likelihood of encountering
 a one followed by 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 zero's in a given string.
 In a previous section, an average value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 was defined, but this was not quite correct, as the average was taken over
 a measure that was not shift-invariant.
 The measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 visualized in the last section is the appropriate measure.
 This follows, as the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 contained only the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion strings, and the algebra of cylinders 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 inherited a shift-invariant weighting from the Bernoulli measure.
 Thus, each string in 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 can now be counted uniformly, which allows averages of properties of strings
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 to be properly taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distances are accessible via some simple considerations.
 Starting with any number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, the first digit in the expansion will be a one if 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}\le T_{\beta}(x)\le1$
\end_inset

.
 A string of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 zeros follow if 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le T_{\beta}^{j}(x)<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $1<j\le m+1$
\end_inset

.
 The first condition is satisfied if 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{2\beta}\le x\le\frac{1}{\beta}\quad\mbox{ or }\quad\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2\beta}\le x\le\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\quad\mbox{or }\quad1+\frac{1}{2\beta}\le x\le1+\frac{1}{\beta}
\]

\end_inset

There are three pre-images, as the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\beta}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is non-zero for values 
\begin_inset Formula $1<x$
\end_inset

.
 The second condition is satisfied if 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\beta^{m}\left(T_{\beta}\left(x\right)-\frac{1}{2}\right)<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

; that is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{2}\le T_{\beta}\left(x\right)<\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\frac{1}{\beta^{m}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The intersection with the three intervals is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2\beta}\le x\le\frac{1}{2\beta}\left(1+\frac{1}{\beta^{m}}\right) & \quad\mbox{ or }\\
\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2\beta}\le x\le\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2\beta}\left(1+\frac{1}{\beta^{m}}\right) & \quad\mbox{ or }\\
1+\frac{1}{2\beta}\le x\le1+\frac{1}{2\beta}\left(1+\frac{1}{\beta^{m}}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The corresponding cylinders are to be sampled out of the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 of encountering such an 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 corresponds to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(\beta\right)=\int_{a}^{b}d\mu_{\beta}+\int_{c}^{d}d\mu_{\beta}+\int_{e}^{f}d\mu_{\beta}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[a,b\right]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[c,d\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[e,f\right]$
\end_inset

 are the three pre-images above.
 This gives the expectation value for the distance between such cylinders:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{0}^{4/3}\ell\left(\beta\right)d\mu_{\beta}=\frac{1}{p\left(\beta\right)}
\]

\end_inset

(Here, the 
\begin_inset Formula $4/3$
\end_inset

 is taken as an 
\emph on
ad hoc
\emph default
 value above which the measure always vanishes; more precisely, the upper
 bound is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\varphi+1\right)/2$
\end_inset

 given by the 
\begin_inset Formula $m=2$
\end_inset

 transition; the actual upper bound depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The argument can also be rephrased in the language of physics.
 The distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\left(\beta\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\ell_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 has an a priori 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-dependence, and so, when considering the distance between branch points
 in a thermalized orbit, one must use the corresponding thermalized measure
 for sampling.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 priovides that thermalized measure.

Generalized Measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observation that the Renyi-Gelfond-Parry measure is just the Bernoulli
 measure restricted to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-subshift opens the door to playing games with the generalized measures.
 The general idea can be made more explicit.
 The Bernoulli measure on the full shift can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu\left(x\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Theta\left(b^{n}\left(1\right)-x\right)}{2^{n+1}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

 is the Bernoulli shift given in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Bernoulli shift"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Clearly, 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{n}\left(1\right)=1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta\left(1-x\right)=1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le1\le1$
\end_inset

 and thus the sum trivially leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(x\right)=1$
\end_inset

 which is just the Bernoulli measure.
 The Renyi-Gelfond-Parry measure is just a rescaling.
 The orbit of 1 is no longer 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{n}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 but is 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{n}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 and the unit interval is not stretched out to twice the thinness but to
 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

 of the thinness, and so one has
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nu\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{F}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Theta\left(t^{n}\left(1\right)-x\right)}{\beta^{n+1}}
\]

\end_inset

up to a normalization constant 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The uniform Bernoulli measure is associated with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1/2$
\end_inset

 of a fair coin flip; of course, one can consider biased coins, with some
 other probability.
 That is, the measure of the cylinder 
\begin_inset Formula $0***\cdots$
\end_inset

 is asigned a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and the measure of the cylinder 
\begin_inset Formula $1***\cdots$
\end_inset

 is given the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $1-p$
\end_inset

.
 When graphed on the unit interval, this gives a characteristically fractal
 shape, shown in figure XXX.
