Linas' Fractals
===============
Analytic Combinatorics and Dynamical Systems
--------------------------------------------

This git repo contains a large collection of software and dozens of
formal papers exploring a range of concepts in self-similarity.
This is the code that was used to create the pictures found in
[Linas Art Gallery](https://linas.org/art-gallery), as well as the
text source for the PDF's in
[Linas Math page](https://linas.org/math/sl2z.html) (subtitled
*The Modular Group and Fractals*).

Most of the content is closely related to one-another, exploring
the relationships between the following topics:

* Continued fractions
* Rational numbers
* The Modular Group SL(2,Z)
* The Cantor Set
* The Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing (GKW) operator
* The Minkowski Question Mark function
* The Minkowski measure (the "derivative" of the Question Mark)
* Symmetries of period-doubling maps
* de Rham curves
* The Bernoulli Map
* The Beta Transform bx mod 1
* Subshifts
* Analytic Number Theory
* Newton Series
* Riemann Hypothesis
* Hurwitz zeta function
* Ramanujan identities
* The Divisor Operator
* Mode locking in the Circle Map

All of the above are deeply inter-related with one-another, and, in a
certain sense, are all "isomorphic", exhibiting different manifestations
of "the same thing": the Cantor set. There's so much here, mostly
because the Cantor set is a very rich system.

There's also some unrelated content in here, having to do with either
linguistics, or with quantum mechanics.
