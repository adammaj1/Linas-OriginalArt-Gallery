 * Perform binary expansion of x. Use L,R for binary digits 0,1.
 * Concatenate the L and R to form a matrix. Pad on the right with
 * zeros. The resulting fractional linear transform will map the
 * entire complex plane to b/d. This function returns b/d.

 * Basically, this function maps the dyadic tree to the
