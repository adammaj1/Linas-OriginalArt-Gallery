This directory has code that explores the Beta Transform
which is the iterated eqn  (bx mod 1)  for 1< b < 2

Almost all code is written to use K = b/2

Here's what we got:

remap.c: the expander and compressor from the paper

sidorov.c: like above, but with multiple expansions.
sidorov-big.C: bignum version of above

skew.c: Skew Takagi map and skew Haar wavelet

reigen.c: Recursve eigenfunctions for the undershift (fast algo)
    Computes only the invariant measure. See also complex.c
    rexfer.c is another early failed attempt at decaying eigenfunctions

beta.c: sanity-check experiments against exact Parry-Gel'fond
    expression for invariant measure.

bernie.C: feignbaum-style diagrams of various maps, low precision.

bigbern.C: like above but arbitrary precision

unbernie.C: something else ... ??

fp-diagram.C: exact frobenius-perron eigenstate using reigen.c

psi*c: the hessenberg eigenfunctions

island: from bernie.C 

deguess.c: contorted sums over the invariant measure bits

almost.c:
alldisk.C:
betadisk.C:   all explore the constant term E(beta;zeta)
      Sample run for K=beta/2=0.85
      ./betadisk betadisk 600 600 0 0.0 0.0 2.4 0.85

zetadisk.c: like above, but just a radial slice.
