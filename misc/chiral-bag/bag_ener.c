C       LOOK FOR ZEROS of efn IN THE INTERVAL A .LE. ZERO .LE. B

C       WE WILL NOT SEARCH FOR ZEROS NEAR ZERO, EXCEPT FOR K=0.
C       WHY? FOR LARGE KAY, THERE ARE DEFINETLY NO
C       ZEROS NEAR ZERO.  HOWEVER, FOR LARGE KAY, EFN (OMEGA) IS
C       *VERY* *SMALL* NEAR OMEGA = ZERO, AND, IF ONE IS NOT CAREFUL,
C       THE ALGORITHM WILL RETURN SPURIOUS ZEROS. THUS, WE START THE
C       SEARCH AWAY FROM ZERO.

C       THERE ARE FURTHER PITFALLS:  AS ENERGY INCREASES, ONE TENDS
C       TO FIND PAIRS OF EIGENVALUES THAT ARE VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.
C       IF ONE IS NOT CAREFUL, THEN ONE WILL MISS BOTH. AS A CURE,
C       ONE MAY ATTEMPT TO USE A SMALL INCREMENT IN THE SEARCH FOR
C       ZEROS, OR, ALTERNATLY, DECREASE THE INTERVAL AS THE SEARCH
C       GOES ON. I'VE CHOOSEN A DECREASING STEP SIZE.  I HOPE IT
C       DECREASES SUFICIENTLY RAPIDLY TO CATCH ALL THE ZEROS.

C       GOT IT: FOR LARGE ENERGIES, ENERGY LEVELS OCCUR IN APPROXIMATELY
C       DEGENERATE PAIRS.  THE SPLITTING BETWEEN PAIRS OCCURS AT INTERVALS
C       OF PI + O(1/ENERGY). THE INTRA-PAIR SPLITTING GOES LIKE
C       DELTA ENERGY = 1/( (PI/2) * N ) + O(1/N**2)
C       WHERE N DENOTES THE NTH ENERGY LEVEL.  THEREFORE, WE NEED THE STEP
C       SIZE TO BE .LT. DELTA ENERGY IF WE ARE TO CATCH BOTH MEMEBERS OF
C       THE PAIR.
