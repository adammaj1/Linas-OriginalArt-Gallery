Greatest Prime Factor exploration
---------------------------------
April 2016 -- revised June, October 2016


OK, lots of data here is duplicated --
the issue was that the code had an off-by-one error in the factorial.
This makes almost no difference, in most results, but it does change
the asymptotic behavior, and thus requires a recompute of stuff.
Error discovered in october 2016

The off-by-one error was this: I was computing
sum_{n=1}  gpf(n) z^n / (n-1)!

---------------

WTF:  poch rising...
poch has pole at z=0 -- phase winds around to right.
It has saddle on the neg x axis near 0.6 ..


the flattened version

./gpf-2d  recip-flat 300 300 13 1.5 0.5 1.0 0.03

generate directory:

draw.c
sum diff paste   -- sum.c
renorm

Masking is done with thesscribe function:
mask foo scribe fout
