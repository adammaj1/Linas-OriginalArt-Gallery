I'm looking for tools to solve this 'simple' Hilbert-space problem:

Given a C-valued function g(z) that is C-oo differentiable at z=0,
Define a Hilbert space operator G with matrix elements 
G(m,n) = g^(m+n)(0) / m! n!  where g^(k)(0) is the k'th derivative
of g at z=0.   Question: what are the eignevalues & eigenvectors of G?
Bonus: What is Ker G, Im G ?   I'm looking for references for this 
problem in general (and want to solve it for a specific g(z) in particular).

Note that we can use G to map (differentiable) functions into functions:
If f(z) = Sum_k  f^(k) z^k / k!  then there is an h = Gf where the 
derivatives of h(z) at z=0 are h^(n)/n! = Sum_m G(n,m) f^(m)/m!  
This mapping is interesting because it arises in the study of 
iterated (chaotic)  mappings (in my case, G is the Frobenius-Perron
operator of a particular chaotic mapping I'm interested in).

For g(z) a polynomial, the solution is easy.  However, I didn't see any simple answer for g(z) = exp(z), never mind any of the 'classical' 
functions you'd see in Abramowitz & Stegun.  How do I go about this business?
