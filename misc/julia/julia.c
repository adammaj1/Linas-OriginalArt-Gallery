/*
 * julia.c
 * Julia set explorer for the mandelbrot bulb
 *
 * Two ideas are at work here.
 * 1) We want to asign a string of L,R values to each point in
 *    the Julia set, so that we can re-interpret the LR string as a
 *    binary string, and then play the usual games on it.
 * 2) The above assignment is not unique, because the location of
 *    the cut of sqrt is not unique, but can be swiveled around by
 *    2pi.  Thus, the effect of the cut location is explored as well.
 *    This is encoded as the "rot" parameter ast the last argument.
 *
 * Hmmm. The above is written assuming the cut is a straight line
 * from the origin to infiny. In fact, the cut could be any snaky,
 * snarky non-self-intersecting curve from the origin to infinite.
 * Hmmm.
 *
 * Here's an interesting one: -0.8 0.2 3.0777  This results in an
 * almost-clean squential connect-the-dots sequence for the points
 * in the julia set, when laid out in order.  Almost, not quite,
 * I think that tuning  therot angle might clean it up...
 * I wonder how rot is related to the ray angle ...
 *
 * Other than this, the output is really pretty normal for the standard
 * Julia set for the Mandelbrot bulb.
