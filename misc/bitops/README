This directory has code that exxplores the Beta Transform
which is the iterated eqn  (bx mod 1)  for 1< b < 2

Most code talks about K = b/2

Here's what we got:

remap.c: the expander and compressor from the paper

skew.c: Skew Takagi map and skew Haar wavelet

reigen.c: Recursve eigenfunctions for the undershift (fast algo)

bernie.C: feignbaum-style diagrams of various maps, low precision.

bigbern.C: like above but arbitrary precision

unbernie.C: something else ... ??

fp-diagram.C: exact frobenius-perron eigenstate using reigen.c
