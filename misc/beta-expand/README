This directory contains code to explore alternate beta-expansions. It
goes with the paper beta-expand.lyx.

sidorov.C: Basic beta expansion, with multiple alternative expansions.
sidorov-big.C: bignum version of above. Also does  a lot more, a much
      better API.

sidorov-big.C: the common bignum code
sidorov-length.C: explore the distnace between branch points

sidorov-bifur.C: failed experiment to draw fake bifurcation diagrams.
sidorov-density.C: color rendition of of extended measure
sidorov-measure.C: try to guess what the extended measure is.
