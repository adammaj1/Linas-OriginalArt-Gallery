This directory contains code to explore alternate beta-expansions. It
goes with the paper beta-expand.lyx.

sidorov.C: Basic beta expansion, with multiple alternative expansions.
sidorov-big.C: bignum version of above. Also does  a lot more, a much
      better API.

It got split into pieces:
sidorov-big.C: the common bignum code
sidorov-length.C: explore the distance between branch points

sidorov-bifur.C: failed experiment to draw fake bifurcation diagrams.

extended-density.C: core code to compute the extended density via histogram.
sidorov-density.C: color rendition of of extended measure
branching-measure.C: try to guess what the extended measure is.

sidorov-misc.C

extended-density.C: brute-force historgram of extended measure

extended-debug.C: verify that the exhaustive string maker is 
            producing expansions correctly
ext-debug.C: verify that the interval approach is producing
             expansinos correctly

ext-iterate.C: iterate directly, based on interval

branching-coeff.C: like branching-measure.C, but hold y constant and
                   vary beta.
