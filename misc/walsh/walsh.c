 *
 * Walsh functions provide a basis for square-integrable functions.
 * Walsh functions can be enumerated using integers that have non-zero
 * Mobius mu values. Walsh functions are even or odd, depending on 
 * whether mu is positive or negative.
 *
 * The code here creates the Walsh functions, indexing them with integers.
 * This allows various series to be explored.
 *
 * The 'prime factors' of the walsh functions are the Rademacher functions.
