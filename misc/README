directories:

../generate: pre 2010
   -- all the 2D work prioer to the 2010 refactoring is in this
      directory, including the fractals, the ordinary generating
      functions of the number-theoretic functions, etc.

arithmexpic: Oct 2106
   -- exponential generating function for the number-theoretic
      functions.

num-theory: 2005-2007
   -- graphs of slices of ord. generating functions of number-theoretic
      functions, with an attempt to find minkowski-like behavior.

calkin-wilf: Sept 2015
   -- a recursive function that gives the denominator of the
      Stern-Brocot tree. Graphing it, its reminiscent of Mink
      measure.

graph:
   -- schroedinger eqn on a 1D lattice

geodesic:
   -- explores the symbol dynamics of the SL(2,Z) fundamental domain.


measure: Sept 2015
   -- (exact) approximation and bound for the measure, inclusing scaling of
      the thing.

norlund-rice:
	-- grpahs plot of riemann zeta, and numeric show of one of
	   Baez-Duarte's Riemann sums. Minor stuff

plouffe:
  -- checks a series of Riemann zeta identities for some of 
     Plouffe's sums 

schroedinger:
   -- solving misc 1-d schroedinger equations.

ffbasis: Dec 2014
   -- falling factorial basis for divisor/multiplicative functions


gpf: April, Oct 2016
   -- Greatest Prime factor, exponential generating function.

arithmexpic: Oct 2016
   -- exponential generating function, for other arithmetic functions
