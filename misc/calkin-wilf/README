The calkin-wilf tree and the "fusc" function.

Turns out the fusc function gives exactly teh denominators of
the stern-brocot tree (there is no strictly analogous function
for the numerators).

Graphing the denominators-only gives a blanc-mange-like function,
more extreme than the usual blanc-mange, since it descends very
low. However, its not quite the derivative of the question-mark,
either, although it sure seems close, suggestive.

There does not appear to be any easy way to rescue it and convert
it to the question mark, although with more cleverness, this should be
possible, i.e. by reconstructing the denominator properly, and
proceeding from there....
