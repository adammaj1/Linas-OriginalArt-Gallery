Greatest Prime Factor exploration
---------------------------------
April 2016 -- revised June, October 2016


OK, lots of data here is duplicated --
the issue was that the code had an off-by-one error in the factorial.
This makes almost no difference, in most results, but it does change
the asymptotic behavior, and thus requires a recompute of stuff.
Error discovered in october 2016

The off-by-one error was this: I was computing
sum_{n=1}  gpf(n) z^n / (n-1)!

---------------

WTF:  poch rising...
poch has pole at z=0 -- phase winds around to right.
It has saddle on the neg x axis near 0.6 ..


the flattened version is done like so:

./gpf-2d  recip-flat 300 300 13 1.5 0.5 1.0 0.03

The scribed lines are drawn with scribe.C
  scribe dash 800 800 1 0.5 0.5 1
  ./cvt.sh
  convert dash.png -fuzz 15% -fill white -opaque red dashw.png
  convert recip-flat-16-fixed.png dashw.png -transparent black -gravity center -compose over -composite recip-flat-16-white.png


and then merged with with code in the generate directory:
The sum.c file which does sum, diff, paste, mask etc.

Masking is done with the scribe function:
mask foo scribe fout
